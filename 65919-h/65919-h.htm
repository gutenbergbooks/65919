<p class="dropcap">A few, and only a few, words are needed to introduce
the History of the Fylde to the public. In its
preparation my aim has been to make the work
as comprehensive in description and detail as the prescribed
limits would allow, and I have endeavoured to write in a style free
from any tendency to pedantry, and I hope, also, from dulness.
How far these conditions have been fulfilled I must now leave
to the judgment of the reader, doing so with some degree of
confidence that at any rate the attempt will be generally
appreciated, if the success be not universally acknowledged.
In the course of my labours I have availed myself of the
works of various authors, and desire to acknowledge my
indebtedness, especially to Baines’s Lancashire, Fishwick’s
Kirkham, Thornber’s Blackpool, and many volumes of the
Cheetham and other historical societies. My thanks for
valuable aid are also due to the following gentlemen, amongst
others, the Ven. Archdeacon Hornby, of St. Michael’s-on-Wyre;
the Rev. W. Richardson, of Poulton-le-Fylde; Col. Bourne, M.P.,
of Hackensall and Heathfield; John Furness, esq., of Fulwood;
W. H. Poole, esq., of Fleetwood; and the Bailiffs of Kirkham.</p>

<p class="dropcap">The large district of western Lancashire, denominated
from time immemorial the Fylde, embraces one third
at least of the Hundred of Amounderness, and a line
drawn from Ashton, on the Ribble, to Churchtown,
on the Wyre, forms the nearest approach to an eastern boundary
attainable, for although the section cut off by its means includes
more land and villages than properly appertain to the Fylde, a
more westerly division would exclude others which form part of it.
The whole of the parishes of Bispham, Lytham, Poulton, and
St. Michael’s; and the parish of Kirkham, exclusive of Goosnargh-with-Newsham
and Whittingham, are comprised in the Fylde
country.</p>

<p>The word Amounderness was formerly considered to signify
the “Promontory of Agmund,” or “Edmund,” and this origin is
alluded to in a treatise written some years since by Mr. Thomas<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
Baines on the “Valley of the Mersey,” in which the following
remarks occur:—“In the year 911 the Northumbrians themselves
began the war, for they despised the peace which King Edward
and his ‘Witan’ offered them, and overran the land of Mercia.
After collecting great booty they were overtaken on their march
home by the forces of the West Saxons and the Mercians, who
put them to flight and slew many thousands of them. Two
Danish Kings and five Earls were slain in this battle. Amongst
the Earls slain was Agmund, the governor, from whom the
Hundred of Agmunderness (Amounderness) was probably named.”
In order that the reader may properly comprehend why Mr.
Baines should surmise that Amounderness received its title from
the Danish Earl, Agmund, it may be stated that the extensive
province of Northumbria, then colonised by the Northmen or
Danes, embraced, amongst other territory, the district afterwards
called Lancashire, and, consequently, the Hundred of Amounderness
would be in a great measure under Danish governance.
When, however, we call to mind that the Danes did not invade
England until A.D. 787, and learn that this Hundred was entered
in the Ripon grant in A.D. 705, as Hacmunderness, it becomes
obvious that the name cannot have been conferred upon it by that
nation, and some other source must be looked to for its origin.
In Gibsons’ Etymological Geography there is “Anderness” (for
Ackmunderness) described as a “promontory sheltered by oaks,
(ac, oak; and mund, protection).” As many large trunks of
trees have been discovered beneath the layers of peat in the
extensive local mosses, whilst others have been laid bare along
the shore by the action of the tides, it can be readily believed
that at one time the greater share of the district was clothed
with forests. Leyland, who was antiquary to Henry VIII., and
surveyed the Hundred during the reign of that monarch, 1509-47,
says:—“Al Aundernesse for the most parte in time paste hathe
been full of woods, and many of the moores replenished with hy
fyrre trees; but now such part of Aundernesse as is towarde the
se is sore destitute of woodde.” With such irrefutable evidences
of the early woodland condition of Amounderness, there need be
no hesitation in accepting the signification which Messrs. Gibson
have given to the name—the Ness or Promontory protected by
oaks. The word Fylde is regarded simply as a corruption of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
“Field.” Camden in his “Britannia” of 1590, writes:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Tota est campestris, unde Fild pro Field appellatur.”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>(The whole is champaign, whence it is called Fild for Field.)</p>

</div>

<p>In a subsequent edition of the same work Fild is spelt File, and
the latter orthography was used in Fileplumpton, in the Duchy
records, afterwards called Fylde Plumpton, and now Wood
Plumpton. The Fylde section of this Hundred is a level
well-watered country, highly cultivated and richly productive,
especially of grain, from which circumstance it was formerly
designated the corn-field of Amounderness.</p>

<p>Anterior to the third invasion of the Romans in A.D. 43, the
inhabitants of the Fylde and other portions of Lancashire lying
between the range of mountains which separates this county
from Yorkshire, and the coast about the Bay of Morecambe,
were called the Setantii or Segantii, “the dwellers in the country
of water,” but at that date the whole tract populated by these
people was included in the more extensive province of the
Brigantes, comprehending what are now known as the six
counties of York, Durham, Northumberland, Westmoreland,
Cumberland, and Lancaster. The Fylde at that epoch would be
composed chiefly of morasses and forests, interspersed with limited
areas and narrow paths of more stable land, and there can be
little doubt that the dwellers on such an uninviting spot must
have been very few, but that it was traversed and, as far as
practicable, inhabited by the ancient Setantii is evident from
the several relics of them which have been discovered amongst
the peat in modern days. Two or three canoes, consisting of
light wooden frameworks, covered with hides, were found by a
man named Jolly, about half a century ago, when cutting the
“Main Dyke” of Marton Mere;<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Celtic hammers, axes, and spears
have also been taken out of the mosses in the district, all of
which were doubtless originally the property of the aboriginal
Britons. The bay of Morecambe and the river Wyre acquired
their distinctive appellations from the Setantii, the one being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
derived from the Celtic <i>gwyr</i>, pure or fresh, and the other from
<i>mawr</i>, great, and <i>cam</i>, winding or bent.</p>

<p>The hardihood of the native Britons of these parts is attested by
Dion Cassius, who informs us that they lived on prey, hunting,
and the fruits of trees, and were accustomed to brave hunger,
cold, and all kinds of toil, for they would “continue several days
up to their chins in water, and bear hunger many days.” In the
woods their habitations were wicker shelters, formed of the
branches of trees interwoven together, and, in the open grounds,
clay or mud huts. They were indebted to the skins of
animals slain in the chase for such scanty covering as they
cared to wear, and according to Cæsar and other writers, dyed
their bodies with woad, which produced a blue colour, and had
long flowing hair, being cleanly shaved except the head and
upper lip. That the power of endurance possessed by the
Setantii, and the neighbouring Brigantes is not to be understood
literally as expressed by Cassius may, we venture to think, be
taken for granted. It can scarcely be credited that the human
frame could ever be reduced or exalted to such an amphibious
condition as to be indifferent whether it passed a number of days
on dry land or under water; it seems more probable that in his
description Cassius referred to the hunting and other expeditions
of the inhabitants into the forests and morasses of the Fylde and
similarly wooded and marshy tracts, where there is no question
the followers of the chase would be more or less in a state of
immersion during the whole time they were so engaged.</p>

<p>The religion of the Setantii was Druidical, and their deities
resembled those of other heathen nations, such as the Romans
and Greeks of that era, but differed in their names. Cæsar tells
us that this order of priesthood was presided over by a superior,
who was known as the chief Druid, and had almost unlimited
authority over all the rest. The Druids were settled at various
points of the island, where they erected their temples, but in
addition to these principle stations, many of their order were
scattered amongst the native tribes of Britain, over which they
appear to have exercised the functions and power of judges,
arranging both public and private disputes, and deciding all
criminal cases. It was part of the creed professed by the Setantii,
to vow, when they were engaged in warfare, that they would,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
through the agency of the Druids, immolate human victims as
an atonement for slaughtered enemies, believing that unless
man’s life were given for man’s life, the divine anger of the
immortal Gods could not be appeased. There were other
sacrifices of the same kind instituted at regularly appointed
seasons and on special occasions. The Setantii also believed in
an immortal soul, but seem to have had no idea of a higher
state, as their priests inculcated the doctrine that after death the
soul was transported to another body, “imagining that by this
the men were more effectually roused to valour, the fear of death
being taken away.”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Ornaments called “Druids’ eggs,” and
worn only by these priests, have been found in the Fylde.</p>

<p>How Cæsar, in B.C. 54 and 55, invaded Britain a first and a
second time, achieving at best an empty conquest, and how,
after his death, the emperor Claudius sent over an army with a
determination to exterminate the Druids, and after thirty pitched
battles, subdued province after province, is beyond the limits of
this work to state, but as a connecting link of the history of the
country with that of our own county, and that portion of it
especially under examination, it may be stated that Britain was
finally conquered by the Romans under Julius Agricola, and that
the best investigation of the subject leads to the opinion that the
district which we call Lancashire, was brought into subjection
to the Roman conqueror in A.D. 79. A vigorous resistance was
for long offered to the army of invaders in the territory of the
Setantii by the natives under the Brigantine chief Venutius, but
the well drilled legions of the Romans, when commanded by
Agricola, proved too formidable to be checked or broken by the
wild, undisciplined valour of the Setantii. Tacitus, the son-in-law
of the general, informs us that early in the summer of A.D. 79,
Agricola personally inspected his soldiers, and marked out many
of the stations, one of which, either made at that time or later
by the same people, was situated at Kirkham, on the line of the
Roman road running from the mouth of Wyre, which will be
described hereafter. He explored the estuaries and woods
along the western coast of Lancashire, and harassed the enemy
by sudden and frequent incursions. When the Brigantes and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
Setantii had been thoroughly overawed and disheartened by the
invincible Romans, Agricola stayed his operations in order to
shew them the blessings of peace, and in that way many towns
which had bravely held out were induced to surrender and give
hostages. These places he surrounded with guards and
fortifications. The following winter was passed in endeavouring,
by various incentives to pleasure, to subdue the warlike nature of
the Britons, thereby diminishing the danger of an outbreak,
especially amongst such tribes as the Setantii, whose intrepid
spirits had been so difficult to quell, and who were not likely to
submit quietly to the yoke of the conqueror, unless some means
were adopted to allure them by the charms of civilised luxury
from their free field and forest mode of existence. Temples,
courts of justice, and comfortable habitations were first erected;
the sons of the petty chiefs were next instructed in the liberal
arts, and Agricola professed to prefer the genius of the Britons
to the attainments of the Gauls. The Roman dress became the
fashion, and the <i>toga</i> was frequently worn. The “porch,
luxurious baths, and elegant banquets” were regularly instituted,
and by degrees the crafty design of the Roman general was
accomplished, and the vanquished Britons had ceased to be the
hardy warriors of old.</p>

<p>About one century after the subjugation of Britain by Agricola
no less than seven important Roman stations, or garrisoned
places, had risen up in the county of Lancaster, and were situated
at Manchester, Colne, Warrington, Lancaster, Walton-le-dale,
Ribchester, and Overborough. The minor ones, such as Kirkham,
supposing their sites to have been first built upon in a season of
warfare, subsequently became small settlements only, and were,
in all probability, unused as military depots. The rivers which
flowed in the neighbourhood of the several encampments,
terminated in three estuaries, denominated by Ptolemy,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> the
ancient geographer, in his book, completed in A.D. 130, the
Seteia Æstuarium, the Moricambe Æstuarium, and the Belisama<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
Æstuarium. The first of these estuaries is generally regarded as
the mouth of the Dee, the second is identified with Morecambe
Bay, and the third with the Ribble by some historians and the
Mersey by others. The same authority mentions also a Portus
Setantiorum, which has been located on the banks of the Ribble,
Lune, and Mersey, by different antiquarians, but in the opinion
of the most recent writers the ancient harbour of the Setantii was
situated at the mouth of the river Wyre. Further reference to the
Setantian port will be made in a later page of the present chapter.</p>

<p>At the shore margin of the warren at Fleetwood there was
visible, about forty years ago, the abrupt and broken termination
of a Roman road, which could be traced across the sward, along
the Naze below Burn Hall, and onward in the direction of Poulton.
From that town it ran in a southerly line towards Staining,
crossing Marton Mere, on its way, in the cutting of which its
materials were very apparent, and lying on the low mossy lands
to the depth of two yards in gravel. From Staining it proceeded
to Weeton, and in a hollow near to the moss of that township,
consisted of an immense stony embankment several yards in
height; in the moss itself the deep beds of gravel were distinctly
observable, and from there the road continued its course up the
rising ground to Plumpton, the traces as usual being less obvious
on the higher land. From Plumpton it travelled towards the
elevated site of a windmill between Weeton moss and Kirkham,
at which point it turned suddenly, and joined the public road,
running in a continuous straight line towards the latter town.
The greater part of the long street of Kirkham is either upon
or in the immediate vicinity of the old Roman road. From
Kirkham the road directed its course towards Lund church,
somewhere in the neighbourhood of which it was joined by
another path formed by the same people and commencing at the
Neb of the Naze near Freckleton.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Leaving Lund it ran through
Lea on to Fulwood moor, where it took the name of Watling
street, and proceeded on to Ribchester. This road has always been
known in the Fylde as the Danes’ Pad, from a tradition that
those pirates made use of it at a later period in their incursions
into our district, visiting and ransacking Kirkham, Poulton, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
other towns or hamlets of the unfortunate Saxons. Numerous
relics, chiefly of the Roman soldiery, have been dug or ploughed
up at different times out of the soil, bordering on the road, or
found amongst the pebbles of which it was composed, and
amongst them may be mentioned spears, both British and Roman,
horse shoes in abundance, several stone hammers, a battle axe,
a broken sword, and ancient Roman coins, all of which were
picked up along its line between Wyre mouth and Weeton.
Several half-baked urns marked with dots, and pieces of rudely
fashioned pottery were discovered in an extensive barrow or cairn
near Weeton-lane Heads, which was accidentally opened, and is
now pointed out as the abode of the local hairy ghost or boggart.
In the neighbourhood of Kirkham there have been found many
broken specimens of Roman pottery, stones prepared for building
purposes, eight or ten urns, some containing ashes and beads,
stone handmills for corn grinding, ancient coins, “Druids’ eggs,”
axes, and horse shoes; in the fields near Dowbridge, where several
of the above urns were discovered, there was found a flattened
ivory needle, about five or six inches long with a large eyelet.
A cuirass was also picked up on the banks of the Wyre; but the
most interesting relic of antiquity is the boss or umbo of a shield,
taken out of a ditch near Kirkham, which will be fully described
in the chapter devoted to that township. The Romans were
accustomed to make three kinds of roads, the first of which,
called the Viæ Militares, were constructed during active warfare,
when they were engaged in pushing their way into the territory
of the enemy, and easy unobstructed communication between
their various encampments became a matter of the utmost
importance. The second, or public roads, were formed to facilitate
commerce in time of peace; and the third were narrower paths,
called private roads. The county of Lancaster was intersected by
no less than four important Roman routes, two of which ran from
north to south, and two traversed the land from west to east.
The course of one road, and perhaps the best constructed of the
whole four, we have just followed out; of the remainder, the first,
commencing at Carlisle, passed near Garstang and Preston, crossed
the Irwell at Old Trafford, and maintaining its southerly direction,
ultimately arrived at Kinderton, in Cheshire. The second
extended from Overborough to Slack, in Yorkshire, passing on its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
way through Ribchester, the Ribble, Radcliffe, Prestwich, and
Newton Heath; whilst the third had its origin at a ford on the
Mersey, in close proximity to Warrington, and from that spot
could be traced through Barton, Eccles, Manchester, Moston,
Chadderton, Royton, and Littleborough, thence over Rumbles
Moor to Ilkley, where was located the temple of the goddess
Verbeia. It is conjectured that these roads, which consisted for
the most part of pavement and deep beds of gravel, were begun,
or at least marked out, by Agricola during the time he was
occupied in the subjugation of Lancashire, and if this very
probable hypothesis be correct the course taken by that general
in his exploration of the woods of the Fylde, and the estuaries
of Morecambe and the Ribble is clearly indicated by the direction
of the ancient path communicating with the mouth of Wyre and
the Naze.</p>

<p>At the opening of the third century the Roman governor of
Britain found it necessary to obtain the personal co-operation
of Severus, in order to put an effectual check to the repeated
outbreaks of the natives; in A.D. 207, that emperor having landed
and established his head-quarters at York, a considerable force
marched northwards under his leadership to punish the revolting
tribes, and it is surmised that the curious road, running across
the mosses of Rawcliffe, Stalmine, and Pilling, was constructed
by the legionaries whilst on this tour. The pathway alluded to,
and commonly known as Kate’s Pad, was deeply situated in the
mosses, and had apparently been formed by fastening riven oak
planks on to sleepers of the same material, secured and held
stationary by means of pins or rivets driven into the marl a little
above which they rested. Its width was about twenty inches, but
in some places rather more.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Herodian, in describing the
expedition of Severus to quell the insurrection of the Briton,
says:—“He more especially endeavoured to render the marshy
places stable by means of causeways, that his soldiers, treading
with safety, might pass them, and having firm footing fight to
advantage. In these the natives are accustomed to swim and
traverse about, being immersed as high as their waists: for going<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
naked as to the greater part of their bodies they contemn the
mud. His army having passed beyond the rivers and fortresses
which defended the Roman territory, there were frequent attacks
and skirmishes, and retreats on the side of the barbarians. To
these indeed flight was an easy matter, and they lay hidden in the
thickets and marshes through their local knowledge; all which
things being adverse to the Romans served to protract the war.”
There can be no doubt that, when the path, which consisted in
some parts of one huge tree and in others of two or more, was
formed, timber must have been very plentiful in the vicinity, and
at the present day numbers of tree trunks of large size are to be
found in the mosses, further corroborating the conclusions arrived
at by Leyland, whose words have already been quoted, and
Holinshed, who wrote:—“The whole countrie of Lancaster has
beene forests heretofore.” An iron fibula, a pewter wine-strainer,
a wooden drinking bowl, hooped with two brass bands and having
two handles, a brass stirrup, and other relics have been taken out
of the moss fields; and in the same neighbourhood an anvil,
several pieces of thin sheet-brass, and a pair of shears were
discovered in a ditch.</p>

<p>About the year 416 the Romans finally removed themselves
from our island, taking with them many of the brave youths of
Britain, and leaving the country in the hands of a people whose
inactive habits, acquired under their dominion, had rendered
them ignorant of the art and unfit for the hardships of warfare.
According to Ethelwerd’s Chronicle, in the year 418 those few of
the Roman race who were left in Britain, not being able to put
up with the manifold insults of the natives, buried their treasure
in pits, hoping that at some future day, when all animosity had
subsided, they would be able to recover it and live peaceably, but
such a fortunate consummation never arrived, and weary at
length of waiting, they assembled on the coasts and “spreading
their canvass to the wind, sought an exile on the shores of Gaul.”
The Saxon Chronicle says:—“This year, A.D. 418, the Romans
collected all the treasures that were in Britain, and some they hid
in the earth so that no one since has been able to find them; and
some they carried with them into Gaul.” It is far from unlikely
that the silver denarii, discovered in 1840 by some brickmakers
near Rossall, and amounting to four hundred coins of Trajan,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
Hadrian, Titus, Vespasian, Domitian, Antonius, Severus, Sabina,
etc., were deposited in that spot for security by one of those
much harassed Romans, previous to his departure from our coast.</p>

<p>A prize so easily to be obtained as Britain in its practically
unprotected state appeared, was not long in attracting the
covetousness of the neighbouring Picts and Scots, who came
down in thousands from the north, forced their way beyond the
Roman Wall erected by Hadrian, occupied the fortresses and
towns, and spread ruin and devastation in their track. The
northern counties were the chief sufferers from these ruthless
marauders. Cumberland, Yorkshire, and Lancashire, were ravaged
and plundered to such an extent that had it not been for the
seasonable assistance of the Saxons, the whole country they
embrace would have been utterly devastated and almost
depopulated. Gildas, the earliest British historian<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>, born about
500, described our land before the incursions of the Picts and
Scots as abounding in pleasant hills, spreading pastures, cultivated
fields, silvery streams, and snow-white sands, and spoke of the
roofs of the buildings in the twenty-eight cities of the kingdom
as “raised aloft with threatening hugeness.” We may readily
conceive how this picture of peace and prosperity was marred and
ruined, as far as the three counties above-named were concerned,
by the destroying hand of the northern nation. The British
towns were still surrounded by the fortified walls and embattled
towers, built by the Romans, but the unfortunate inhabitants, so
long unaccustomed to</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">“The close-wedged battle and the din of war,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and deprived of their armed soldiers and valiant youth, were
panic stricken by the fierce onslaughts of the Scottish tribes, and
fled before their advancing arms. Some idea of the critical and
truly pitiable condition to which they were reduced may be gleaned
from the tenor of an appeal for help sent by them to their old
rulers, which the author last quoted has preserved as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">The Lamentation of the Britons unto Agitius,
thrice Consul.</p>

<p>“The barbarians drive us to the sea, the sea drives us back to the barbarians.
Thus of two kinds of death, one or other must be our choice, either to be
swallowed up by the waves or butchered by the sword.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<p>The Romans were fully occupied with enemies of their own, the
Goths, and consequently were unprepared to offer any assistance
to the Britons, whose position was shortly afterwards rendered
additionally wretched by famine and its attendant evils. At that
period both the state of Lancashire itself and of its inhabitants
must have been exceedingly deplorable—the country ravaged and
still exposed to the depredations and barbarities of the enemy,
had now become a prey to a fearful dearth. Many of the
descendants of the old Setantii, unable any further to support
the double contest, yielded themselves up to the Picts and Scots
in the hope of obtaining food to appease the fierce cravings of
hunger, whilst others, more hardy, but outnumbered and weakened
by long fasts, sought refuge in the woods and such other shelters as
the neighbourhood afforded. Disappointed in the Romans, the
Britons applied for aid to the Saxons, or Anglo-Saxons, a mixed
and piratical tribe, dwelling on the banks of the German Ocean,
and composed of Jutes, Angles, and pure Saxons. The men of
this race are described as determined, fearless, and of great size,
with blue eyes, ruddy complexions, and yellow streaming hair.
They were well practised in warfare, and armed with battle-axes,
swords, spears, and maces. Their chief god was Odin, or Woden,
and their heaven Valhalla. About one thousand of these warriors,
under the command of Hengist and Horsa, embarked in three
vessels, built of hides, and called <i>Cyulæ</i> or <i>Ceols</i>. They landed on
the coast of Kent, about the year 449, and by the direction of
Vortigern, king of the Island, marched northwards until they
arrived near York, where an encounter of great moment took
place, terminating in the utter defeat of the Picts and Scots.
Inspirited by so early and signal a success the Saxons followed up
their advantage with alacrity, drove the baleful marauders out of
the counties of Lancaster and York, and finally compelled them
to retreat across the frontier into their own territory. After
having rescued the kingdom from these invaders the Saxons
settled at York and Manchester, and not only evinced no sign of
returning to their own country, but even despatched messengers
for fresh troops. This strange and suspicious conduct on the part
of their allies excited considerable alarm and anxiety amongst
the Britons, who practically expressed their disapproval by
refusing to make any provision for the reinforcements. After a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
short interval a mandate was issued to the Saxon leader ordering
him to withdraw his army from the soil of Britain. Incensed and
stimulated by such decisive action Hengist determined at once
to carry out the object he had cherished from the first—the
subjugation of the people and the seizure of the island. Having
procured a further supply of men under his son Octa, he
established them in the country of the Brigantes, and almost
immediately invited the native nobles to a friendly conference
with his chiefs on Salisbury plain. The Britons, who were far
from suspecting his treacherous design, attended the assembly
unarmed, and in that defenceless state fell an easy prey to their
Saxon hosts, who in the midst of feasting and revelry, brutally
massacred the whole of their guests. Successful in his cowardly
and murderous stratagem, Hengist took possession of the southern
counties, whilst his son Octa maintained his sway over the
Brigantine province of Northumbria, in which the Fylde was
included, as intimated at the beginning of the chapter.</p>

<p>The ancient warlike spirit of the Setantii, which had lain
almost dormant for centuries, was once more thoroughly aroused
in the natives of Lancashire, and a determined and valiant
opposition offered by them to Octa and his army. Overborough
capitulated only when its inhabitants were worn out by fatigue
and famine, whilst Warrington and Manchester sustained severe
and protracted sieges before they fell into the hands of the enemy.
Nennius, another early historian, who was born towards the end
of the sixth century, informs us that the famous King Arthur and
his sixty Knights of the Round Table worsted the Saxons in
twelve successive battles, four of which were fought on the banks
of the Douglas, near Wigan. In those conflicts our county was
well and effectively represented in the person of Paulinus, the
commander of the right wing of the army, who after many brave
and sanguinary struggles overthrew the hitherto unconquered
Octa, and for a time, at least, delivered the Fylde and other parts
of Northumbria from the rule of the Saxons. This gallant soldier
was the offspring of a union between a Roman warrior and a
British maiden, who had established themselves in Manchester.
The chieftain Ella, however, compelled the Britons to submission,
and assumed the government over part of Northumbria. Clusters
of Saxon huts, soon growing into villages, now sprang up on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
soil of the Fylde, which under the wood-levelling and marsh-draining
Romans had lost much of its swampy and forest
characters and been transformed into a more habitable locality.
We need have little hesitation in conjecturing that the valour
displayed by the inhabitants of our county was greatly increased,
and often rendered almost desperate, by the knowledge that if
their land were subdued and occupied by the Saxons the key, if
it may so be called, to their mountainous strongholds would be
lost, and the line of communication between them impassably
and irretrievably obstructed; for the venerable Bede<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> tells us that
a portion of the Britons fled to the hills and fells of Furness, and
we are aware that a much larger share sought refuge amongst the
mountains of Wales, lying to the south-west, and visible from the
shores of the Fylde. Others escaped over to Armorica in France,
and from them it acquired the name of Brittany. Additional
evidence that Furness was peopled by the Britons, even for more
than two centuries after the arrival of the Saxons, is to be found
in the writings of Camden, who says:—“The Britons in Furness
lived securely for a long time, relying upon those fortifications,
wherewith nature had guarded them; for that the Britons lived
here in the 228th year after the coming of the Saxons, is plain
from hence; that at that time Egfrid, the king of the
Northumbrians, gave to St. Cuthbert the land called Cartmell,
and all the Britons in it; for so it is related in his life.”</p>

<p>The Saxons were great idolaters, and soon crowded the country
with their temples and images. The deities they worshipped
have furnished us with names for the different days of the week,
thus Sunday is derived from <i>Sunan</i> the sun, Monday from <i>Monan</i>
the moon, Tuesday from <i>Tuisco</i> a German god, Wednesday from

<p>When the nation was once more at peace, all the towns and
castles which had been damaged during the wars were repaired,
and others, which had been destroyed, rebuilt. The Britons were
brought by degrees to look with less disfavour on their conquerors,
and as time progressed adopted their heathenish faith and offered
up prayer at the shrines of the same idols, drifting back into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
darkness and forgetting or ignoring those true doctrines which,
it is said, had been declared and expounded to them at the very
commencement of the Christian era. According to Clemens
Romanus and Theodoret, the Apostle Paul was one of the earliest
preachers of the Gospel in Britain, but whatever amount of truth
there may be in this statement, it is certain that at the Council
of Arles in A.D. 314, and ten years later at that of Nicene, three
British bishops were present. All traces of their former religion
quickly vanished from amongst the native population of
Lancashire under the pagan influence of their rulers; and it was
during that unhallowed age that Gregory, surnamed the Great,
and afterwards pontiff, being attracted by the handsome appearance
of some youths exposed for sale in the market-place at Rome, and
finding, on inquiry, that they came from the kingdom of Deira,
in Britain, determined to send over Augustine and Paulinus to
Christianise the inhabitants. In 596 Augustine landed with forty
missionaries on the coast of Kent, the king became a convert, and
the new faith spread rapidly throughout the island. Thousands
were baptised by Paulinus in the river Swale, then called the
Northumbrian Jordan, and the waters of Ribble were also resorted
to for the performance of similar ceremonies.</p>

<p>The advent of the Roman mission initiated a fresh epoch in the
ecclesiastical history of the county, monasteries and religious
houses sprang up in different parts, and at the consecration of the
church and monastery of Ripon, lands bordering on the Ribble,
in Hacmundernesse (Amounderness), in Gedene, and in Duninge
were presented amongst other gifts to that foundation. Paulinus
was created bishop of Northumbria in 627, and it is to his
ministrations and pious example that the conversion of the
inhabitants of the Fylde and vicinal territory is generally
attributed. The Saxon Chronicle records, however, that in 565
Columba “came from Scotia (Ireland) to preach to the Picts.”
Columba was born at Garten, a village in county Donegal, and
according to Selden and other learned writers, the religion
professed by him and the Culdees, as the priests of his order were
called, was strictly Presbyterian. Bede writes:—“They preached
only such works of charity and piety as they could learn from
prophetical, evangelical, and apostolic writings.” Columba
established a monastery at Iona. Dr. Giles states that “the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
ancient name of Iona was I or Hi, or Aoi, which was Latinised
into Hyona, or Iona; the common name of it now is I-colum-kill,
the Island of Colum of the Cells.” Bishop Turner affirms that
“the lands in Amounderness, on the Ribble,” were first presented
to a Culdee abbot, named Eata, on the erection of a monastery at
Ripon, but that before the building was finished he was dismissed
and St. Wilfred made abbot of Ripon, sometime before 661. If
the foregoing assertion be correct there is certain evidence that
the Culdee doctrines were also promulgated in Lancashire, and
doubtless in our own district, at that early date. Bede seems to
support such an assumption when he states that the Ripon lands
were originally granted to those who professed the creed of the
Picts to build a monastery upon, and did not pass to St. Wilfred,
bishop of Northumbria, until afterwards, in 705, when he re-edified
the monastery. Whatever discrepancies may exist as to the exact
period and manner in which Christianity was introduced or
revived in the bosoms of our forefathers, there is ample and
reliable proof that the majority of them had embraced the true
faith about the middle of the seventh century, when churches
were probably erected in the hamlets of Kirkham and St. Michael’s-on-Wyre.</p>

<p>About the year 936 the Hundred of Amounderness was granted
by Athelstan to the See of York:—“I, Athelstan, king of the
Angles, etc., freely give to the Omnipotent God, and to the
blessed Apostle Peter, at his church in the diocese of York, a
certain section of land, not small in extent, in the place which
the inhabitants call Amounderness,” etc. The Hundred of
Amounderness when this grant was made must have been pretty
thickly peopled, for Athelstan states that he “purchased it at no
small price,” and land at that date was valued chiefly by the
number of its residents. Here it will be convenient to observe
that in some instances, as in that of Amounderness, the Hundreds
acquired the additional titles of Wapentakes, and, in explanation of
the origin of the term, we learn from “Thoresby Ducat Leodiens,”
that when a person received the government of a Wapentake, he
was met, at the appointed time and usual place, by the elder
portion of the inhabitants, and, after dismounting from his horse,
he held up his spear and took a pledge of fealty from all according
to the usual custom. Whoever came touched his spear with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
theirs, and by such contact of arms they were confirmed in one
common interest. So from <i>wœpnu</i>, a weapon, and <i>tac</i>, a touch, or
<i>taccare</i>, to confirm, the Hundreds were called <i>Wapentakes</i>.
Traces of the above antique ceremony are still to be met with in
the peculiar form of expression used when the tenantry and others
are summoned by the manorial lords of Amounderness to attend
their court-barons and court-leets.</p>

<p>The Heptarchy, established about 550, and consisting of seven
sovereign states, was finally abolished in 830, and Egbert became
king over the whole island. The province of Northumbria, more
especially the Fylde and tracts of adjoining territory, had at
that date been the scene of irregular and intermittent warfare
during the previous forty years. Lancashire had suffered cruelly
from the visitations of the Northmen, or Danes, who spared
neither age, sex, nor condition in their furious sallies. In the
years 787, 794, and 800, these pirates invaded the soil, ravaged
the country, butchered the inhabitants, and on the last occasion
shot Edmund, the king of the West Saxons, to death with arrows,
because he refused to renounce the Christian faith and embrace
the errors of heathenism. Egbert was no sooner seated on the
throne than the Danes re-appeared off the coasts, and there can
be little doubt that some of their bands made their way down the
western shore of the island, entered the Bay of Morecambe, and,
guided by the old Roman road near the mouth of the Wyre,
pushed onwards into and through the heart of the Fylde,
plundering and laying waste villages, hamlets, and every trace of
agriculture in their path. “The name of the <i>Danes’ Pad</i>,” says
Mr. Thornber, “given to the Roman agger is and ever will be an
everlasting memorial of their ravages and atrocities in this
quarter.”<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> In addition it may be stated that many warlike relics
of the Danes have been found along the road here indicated,
and that the names of the Great and Little Knots in the channel
of Wyre, opposite Fleetwood, were of pure Scandinavian derivation,
and signified “round heaps,” probably, of stones. These mounds
were, during the formation of the harbour entrance, either
destroyed or disfigured beyond recognition. Several localities,
also, along the sea boundary of the Fylde bear Danish denominations,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
which will be treated of hereafter. In 869 Lancashire was
again visited by a dreadful famine, and many of the people in every
part of the county fell victims either to the dearth itself or the fatal
disorders following in its train. Those who were fortunate enough
to escape the wholesale destruction of the scourge suffered so
severely from the merciless massacres of the Danes that at the
accession of Alfred the Great, in 871, our Hundred was but
sparsely populated. During the reign of that illustrious monarch
England was divided into counties, which again were subdivided
into Hundreds. Each Hundred was composed of ten Tithings,
and each Tithing of ten Freeholders and their families. When
this division of the kingdom was effected the south-western
portion of the old province of Northumbria was separated from
the remainder, and received the name of <i>Lonceshire</i>, from the
capital <i>Loncaster</i>, the castle on the <i>Lone</i>, or Lune. Alfred, as we
are told by his biographer Asser, did much to improve the
condition of his subjects both for peace and war; referring to
their illiterate state, on his accession the king himself says:—“When
I took the kingdom there were very few on the south
side of the river Humber, the most improved portion of England,
who could understand their daily prayers in English, or translate
a letter from the Latin. I think they were not many beyond the
Humber. There were so few that I cannot, indeed, recollect one
single instance on the south of the Thames.”<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> After suffering a
defeat at Wilton almost at the outset of his career, Alfred
surprised and overthrew the Danish camp at Eddington;
Guthrum, their leader, and the whole of his followers were taken
prisoners, but afterwards liberated and permitted to colonise East
Anglia, and subsequently Northumbria, an act of clemency which
entailed most disastrous consequences upon the different sections
of the latter province. The Fylde now became the legalised
abode of numbers of the northern race, between whom and the
Saxon settlers perpetual strife was carried on; in addition the
restless and covetous spirit of the new colonists constantly
prompted them to raids beyond the legitimate limits of their
territory, rebellions amongst themselves, and conspiracies against
the king; insurrection followed insurrection, and it was not until<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
Athelstan had inflicted a decisive blow upon the Danish forces,
and brought the seditious province of Northumbria under his
own more immediate dominion, that a short lull of peace was
obtained. In the reign of his successor, however, they broke out
again, and having been once more reduced to order, agreed to
take the name of Christians, abjure their false gods, and live
quietly henceforth. These promises, made to appease the anger
of Edmund, were only temporarily observed, and their turbulent
natures were never tranquilised until Canute, the first Danish
king, ascended the throne of England in 1017. The Norse line
of monarchs comprised only three, and terminated in 1041.
Reverting to Athelstan and the Danes we find that about ten
years after the subjugation of the latter in 926, as recorded in the
Saxon Chronicle, Anlaf, a noted Danish chieftain, made a
vigorous attempt to regain Northumbria. The site of the
glorious battle where this ambitious project was overthrown and
the army of Anlaf routed and driven to seek refuge in flight from
the shore, on which they had but a short time previously
landed exulting in a prospect of conquest and plunder, is a
matter of dispute, and nothing authentic can be discovered
concerning it beyond the fact that the name of the town or
district where the forces met was Brunandune or Brunanburgh,
and was situated in the province of Northumbria. The former
orthography is used in Ethelwerd’s Chronicle:—“A fierce battle
was fought against the barbarians at Brunandune, whereof that
fight is called great even to the present day; then the barbarian
tribes were defeated and domineer no longer; they are driven
beyond the ocean.” Burn, in Thornton township, is one of the
several rival localities which claim to have witnessed the
sanguinary conflict. In the Domesday Survey, Burn was written
<i>Brune</i>, and it also comprises a rising ground or <i>Dune</i>, which
seem to imply some connection with <i>Brunandune</i>. From an
ancient song or poem, bearing the date 937, it is clear that
the battle lasted from sunrise to sunset, and that at night-fall
Anlaf and the remnant of his followers, being utterly discomfited,
escaped from the coast in the manner before described. This
circumstance also upholds the pretentions of Burn, as it is situated
close to the banks of the Wyre, and at a very short distance both
from the Irish Sea and Morecambe Bay, as well as being in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
direct line of the road called Danes’ Pad, the track usually taken
by the Northmen in former incursions into the Fylde and county.
In addition it may be mentioned that tradition affirms that a large
quantity of human bones were ploughed up in a field between
Burn and Poulton about a century ago. Sharon Turner says:—“It
is singular that the position of this famous battle is not yet
ascertained. The Saxon song says it was at Brunanburgh;
Ethelwerd, a contemporary, names the place Brunandune. These
of course are the same place, but where is it?”<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Having done our
best to suggest or rather renew an answer presenting several
points worthy of consideration to Mr. Turner’s query, we will,
before bidding farewell to the subject, give our readers a
translated extract from the old song to which allusion has been
made:—</p>

<p>Athelstan, in order to encourage commerce and agriculture,
enacted that any of the humbler classes, called Ceorls, who had
crossed the sea thrice with their own merchandise, or who,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
individually, possessed five hides of land, a bell-house, a church,
a kitchen, and a separate office in the king’s hall, should be raised
to the privileged rank of Thane. Sometime in the interval
between the death of this monarch, in 941, and the arrival of
William the Conqueror, the Hundred of Amounderness had been
relinquished by the See of York, probably owing to frequent wars
and disturbances having so ruined the country and thinned the
inhabitants that the grant had ceased to be profitable.</p>

<p>During the earlier part of the Saxon era the clergy claimed
one tenth or tithe of the produce of the soil, and exemption for
their monasteries and churches from all taxations. These
demands were resisted for a considerable period, but at length
were conceded by Ethelwulf “for the honour of God, and for his
own everlasting salvation.”<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> In 1002, it is recorded in the Saxon
Chronicle, that “the king (Ethelred) ordered all the Danish men
who were in England to be slain, because it was made known to
him that they would treacherously bereave him of his life, and
after that have his kingdom without any gainsaying.” In
accordance with the royal mandate, which was circulated in secret,
the Anglo-Saxon populace of the villages and farms of the Fylde,
as elsewhere, rose at the appointed day upon the unprepared and
unsuspecting Northmen, barbarously massacring old and young,
male and female alike. Great must have been the slaughter in
districts like our own, where from the Danes having been
established for so many generations and its proximity to the
coast and the estuaries of Wyre and Ribble, a safe landing and a
friendly soil would be insured, and attract numbers of their
countrymen from Scandinavia. The vengeance of Sweyn, king
of Denmark, was speedy and complete; the country of
Northumbria was laid waste, towns and hamlets were pillaged
and destroyed, and for four years all that fire and sword, spurred
on by hatred and revenge, could effect in depopulating and
devastating a land was accomplished in Lancashire, and the
neighbouring counties, by the enraged Dane. Half a century
later than the events just narrated, earl Tosti, the brother of
Harold, who forfeited his life and kingdom to the Norman
invaders on the field of Hastings, was chosen duke of Northumbria.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
The seat of the new ruler has not been discovered, but as far as
his personal association with the Fylde is concerned it will be
sufficient to state that almost on its boundaries, in the township
of Preston, he held six hundred acres of cultivated soil, to which
all the lands and villages of Amounderness were tributary. As a
governor Tosti proved himself both brutal and oppressive. In a
very limited space of time his tyrannical and merciless conduct
goaded his subjects to rebellion, and with one consent they ejected
him from his dukedom and elected earl Morcar in his stead, a
step commended and confirmed by Harold, when the unjust
severity of his brother had been made known to him. Tosti
embraced the Norman cause, and fell at the head of a Norwegian
force in an engagement which took place at Standford a few
months before the famous and eventful battle of Hastings.</p>

<p>We have now traced briefly the history of the Fylde through a
period of eleven hundred years, and before entering on the era
which dates from the accession of William the Conqueror, it will
be well to review the traces and influences of the three dissimilar
races, which have at different epochs usurped and settled on the
territory of the old Setantii; our reference is, of course, to the
Romans, Anglo-Saxons, and Danes. Under the first, great
advances were made in civilisation; clearings were effected in
the woods, the marshes were trenched, and lasting lines of
communication were established between the various stations
and encampments. The peaceful arts were cultivated, and
agriculture made considerable progress, corn even, from some
parts of Britain, being exported to the continent. Remains of the
Roman occupation are to be observed in the names of a few
towns, as Colne and Lincoln, from <i>Colonia</i>, a Colony, also Chester
and Lancaster, from <i>Castra</i>, a Camp, as well as in relics like those
enumerated earlier. The word “street” is derived from <i>Stratum</i>,
a layer, covering, or pavement. Their festival of Flora originated
our May-day celebrations, and the paraphernalia of marriage,
including the ring, veil, gifts, bride-cake, bridesmaids, and
groomsmen, are Roman; so also are the customs of strewing
flowers upon graves, and wearing black in time of mourning.
That the Romans had many stations in the Fylde is improbable,
but that they certainly had one in the township of Kirkham is
shown by the number and character of the relics found there.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
This settlement would seem to have been a fairly populous one,
if an opinion may be formed from the quantity of cinereal urns
discovered at various times, in which had been deposited the
cremated remains of Romans, who had spent their days and done
good service in levelling the forests and developing the resources
of the Fylde. The traffic over the Roman road through the
district must have been almost continuous, to judge from the
abundance of horse-shoes and other matters picked up along its
route, and whether the harbour of the Setantii was on Wyre,
Ribble, or elsewhere, it is evident from the course taken by the
well constructed path that something of importance, say a
favourable spot for embarcation or debarcation, attracted the
inhabitants across the soil of the Fylde towards its north-west
boundary. Now arises the question what was the boundary here
denoted, and in reply we venture to suggest that the extent of
this district, in both a northerly and westerly direction, was much
greater in ancient days than it is in our own, and that the Lune
formed its highest boundary, whilst its seaward limits, opposite
Rossall, were carried out to a distance of nearly eight miles beyond
the existing coast, and comprised what is now denominated
Shell Wharf, a bank so shallowly covered at low water spring
tides that huge boulders become visible all over it. Novel as
such a theory may at first sight appear, there is much that can be
advanced in support of it. From about the point in Morecambe
Bay, near the foot of Wyre Lighthouse, where the stream of
Wyre meets that of Lune at right angles, there is the
commencement of a long deep channel, apparently continuous
with the bed of the latter river as defined by its sandbanks, which
extends out into the Irish Sea for rather more than seven miles
west of the mouth of Morecambe Bay, at Rossall Point. This
channel, called “Lune Deep,” is described on the authorised
charts as being in several places twenty-seven fathoms deep, in
others rather less, and at its somewhat abrupt termination twenty-three
fathoms. Throughout the entire length its boundaries are
well and clearly marked, and its sudden declivity is described by
the local mariners as being “steep as a house side.” Regarding
this curious phenomenon from every available point of view, it
seems more probable to us that so long and perfect a channel was
formed at an early period, when the river Lune was, as we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
conjecture, continued from its present mouth, at Heysham Point,
through green plains, now the Bay of Lancaster, in the direction
and to the distance of “Lune Deep,” than that it was excavated
by the current of Lune, as it exists to-day, after mingling with
the waters of Morecambe and Wyre. The course and completeness
of Wyre channel from Fleetwood, between the sandbanks called
Bernard’s Wharf and North Wharf, to its point of junction with
the stream from Lancaster, prove satisfactorily that at one time
the former river was a tributary of the Lune. Other evidence can
be brought forward of the theory we are wishful to establish—that
the southern portion of Morecambe Bay, from about
Heysham Point, bearing the name of Lancaster Bay, as well as
“Shell Wharf” was about the era of the Romans, dry or, at least,
marshy land watered by the Wyre and Lune, the latter of which
would open on the west coast immediately into the Irish Sea. If
the reader refer to a map of Lancashire he will see at once that
the smaller bay has many appearances of having been added to
the larger one, and that its floor is formed by a continuous line of
banks, uncovered each ebb tide and intersected only by the
channels of Wyre and Lune. The Land Mark, at Rossall Point, has
been removed several times owing to the incursions of the sea, and
within the memory of the living generation wide tracts of soil,
amounting to more than a quarter of a mile westward, have been
swallowed up on that part of the coast, as the strong currents of
the rising tides have swept into the bay; and in such manner
would the land about the estuary of “Lune Deep,” that is the
original river of Lune, be washed away. As the encroachments
of the sea progressed, the channel of the river would be gradually
widened and deepened to the present dimensions of the “Deep”;
the stream of Wyre would by degrees be brought more
immediately under the tidal influence, and in proportion as the
Lune was absorbed into the bay, so would its tributary lose its
shallowness and insignificance, and become expanded to a more
important and navigable size. About the time that “Lune Deep”
had ceased to exist as a river, and become part of the bay, the
overcharged banks of the Wyre would have yielded up their
super-abundance of waters over the districts now marked by
Bernard’s Wharf and North Wharf, and subsequently, as the
waves continued their incursions, inundations would increase,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
until finally the whole territory, forming the site of Lancaster
Bay, would be submerged and appropriated by the rapacious hosts
of Neptune. The “Shell Wharf” would be covered in a manner
exactly similar to the more recently lost fields off Rossall; and as
illustrations of land carried away from the west coast in that
neighbourhood, may be instanced a farm called Fenny, at Rossall,
which was removed back from threatened destruction by the
waves at least four times within the last fifty years, when its
re-building was abandoned, and its site soon swept over by the
billows; also the village of Singleton Thorp, which occupied the
locality marked by “Singleton Skeer” off Cleveleys until 1555,
when it was destroyed by an irruption of the sea. Numerous
other instances in which the coast line has been altered and driven
eastward, between Rossall Point and the mouth of Ribble, during
both actually and comparatively modern days might be cited,
but the above are sufficient to support our view of the former
connection of “Shell Wharf” with the main-land, and its gradual
submersion. If on the map, the Bay of Lancaster be detached
from that of Morecambe, the latter still retains a most imposing
aspect, and its identity with the Moricambe Æstuarium of
Ptolemy is in no way interfered with or rendered less evident.
The foregoing, as our antiquarian readers will doubtless have
surmised, is but a prelude to something more, for it is our purpose
to endeavour to disturb the forty years of quiet repose enjoyed by
the Portus Setantiorum on the banks of the Wyre and hurl it far
into the Irish Sea, to the very limits of the “Lune Deep,” where,
on the original estuary of the river Lune, we believe to be its
legitimate home. No locality, as yet claiming to be the site of
the ancient harbour, accords so well with the distances given
by Ptolemy. Assuming the Dee and the Ribble to represent
respectively, as now generally admitted, the Seteia Æstuarium
and the Belisama Æstuarium, the Portus Setantiorum should lie
about seven miles<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> to the west and twenty-five to the north of the
Belisama. The position of the “Lune Deep” termination is just
about seven miles to the west of the estuary of the Ribble, but is,
like most other places whose stations have been mentioned by
Ptolemy, defective in its latitudinal measurement according to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
the record left by that geographer, being only fifteen instead of
twenty-five miles north of the Belisama or Ribble estuary.
Rigodunum, or Ribchester, is fully thirty miles to the east of the
spot where it is wished to locate the Portus, and thus approaches
very nearly to the forty-mile measurement of Ptolemy, whose
distances, as just hinted, were universally excessive. As an
instance of such error it may be stated that the longitude, east
from Ferro, of Morecambe Bay or Estuary given by Ptolemy, is
3° 40´ in excess of that marked on modern maps of ancient Britannia,
and if the same over-plus be allowed in the longitude of the
Portus Setantiorum a line drawn in accordance, from north to
south, would pass across the west extremity of the “Lune Deep,”
showing that its distance from the Bay corresponds pretty
accurately with that of the Portus from the Morecambe
Æstuarium as geographically fixed by Ptolemy. In describing
the extent and direction of the Roman road, or Danes’ Pad, in his
“History of Blackpool and Neighbourhood,” Mr. Thornber writes:—“Commencing
at the <i>terminus</i>, we trace its course from the
Warren, near the spot named the ‘Abbot’s walk’;” but that the
place thus indicated was not the <i>terminus</i>, in the sense of <i>end</i> or
<i>origin</i>, is proved by the fact that shortly after the publication of
this statement, the workmen engaged in excavating for a sea-wall
foundation in that vicinity came upon the road in the sand on
the very margin of the Warren. Hence it would seem that the
path was continued onwards over the site of the North Wharf
sand bank, either towards the foot of Wyre where its channel
joins that of Lune, and where would be the original mouth of the
former river, or, as we think more probable, towards the Lune
itself, and along its banks westward to the estuary of the stream,
as now marked by the termination of “Lune Deep.” The Wyre,
during the period it existed simply as a tributary of the Lune, a
name very possibly compounded from the Celtic <i>al</i>, chief, and
<i>aun</i>, or <i>un</i>, contractions of <i>afon</i>, a river, must have been a stream
of comparatively slight utility in a navigable point of view, and
even to this day its seaward channel from Fleetwood is obstructed
by two shallows, denominated from time out of mind the Great
and Little Fords. The Lune, or “Chief River,” on the contrary,
was evidently, from its very title, whether acquired from its
relative position to its tributary, or from its favourable comparison<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
with other rivers of the neighbourhood, which is less likely,
regarded by the natives as a stream of no insignificant magnitude
and importance. As far as its navigability was concerned the
Portus may have been placed on its banks near to the junction of
Wyre, but the distances of Ptolemy, which agree pretty fairly,
as shown above, with the location of the Portus on the west
extremity of the present “Lune Deep,” are incompatible with
such a station as this one for the same harbour. The collection
of coins discovered near Rossall may imply the existence in early
days of a settlement west of that shore, and many remains of the
Romans may yet be mingled with the sand and shingle for
centuries submerged by the water of the still encroaching Irish
Sea. Leaving this long-argued question of the real site of the
Portus Setantiorum, in which perhaps the patience of our readers
has been rather unduly tried, and soliciting others to test more
thoroughly the merits of the ideas here thrown out, we will
hasten to examine the traces of the Anglo-Saxons and Danes.</p>

<p>Many, in fact most, of the towns and villages of the Fylde were
founded by the Anglo-Saxons, and have retained the names,
generally in a modified form, bestowed upon them by that race,
as instance Singleton, Lytham, Mythorp, all of which have Saxon
terminals signifying a dwelling, village, or enclosure. The word
<i>hearb</i>, genitive <i>hearges</i>, indicates in the vocabulary of the same
people a heathen temple or place of sacrifice, and as it is to be
traced in the endings of Goosnargh, and Kellamergh, there need
be no hesitation in surmising that the barbarous and pagan rites
of the Saxons were celebrated there, before their conversion to
Christianity. Ley, or lay, whether at the beginning of a name, as
in Layton, or at end, as in Boonley, signifies a field, and is from
the Saxon <i>leag</i>; whilst Hawes and Holme imply, respectively, a
group of thorps or hamlets, and a river island. Breck, Warbreck,
and Larbreck, derive their final syllables from the Norse <i>brecka</i>, a
gentle rise; and from that language comes also the terminal <i>by</i>,
in Westby, Ribby, and other places, as well as the <i>kirk</i> in Kirkham,
all of which point out the localities occupied by the Danes, or
Norsemen. Lund was doubtless the site of a sacred grove of these
colonists and the scene of many a dark and cruel ceremony, its
derivation being from the ancient Norse <i>lundr</i>, a consecrated
grove, where such rites were performed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span></p>

<p>At the present time it is difficult, if indeed possible, to
determine from what races our own native population has
descended, and the subject is one which has provoked more than
a little controversy. Palgrave, in his “History of the Anglo-Saxons,”
says:—“From the Ribble in Lancashire, or thereabouts,
up to the Clyde, there existed a dense population composed of
Britons, who preserved their national language and customs,
agreeing in all respects with the Welsh of the present day; so
that even to the tenth century the ancient Britons still inhabited
the greater part of the west coast of the island, however much
they had been compelled to yield to the political supremacy of
the Saxon invaders.” Mr. Thornber states that he has been
“frequently told by those who were reputed judges” that the
manners, customs, and dialect of the Fylde partook far more of
the Welsh than of the Saxon, and that this was more perceptible
half a century ago than now (1837). “The pronunciation,” he
adds, “of the words—laughing, toffee, haughendo, etc., the
Shibboleth of the Fylde—always reminds me of the deep gutterals
of the Welsh,<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> and the frequent use of a particular oath is, alas!
too common to both.” Another investigator, Dr. Robson, holds
an entirely different opinion, and maintains in his paper on
Lancashire and Cheshire, that there is no sufficient foundation
for the common belief that the inhabitants of any portion of
those counties have been at any time either Welsh, or Celtic;
and that the Celtic tribes at the earliest known period were
confined to certain districts, which may be traced, together
with the extent of their dominions, by the Celtic names of places
both in Wales and Cornwall. From another source we are
informed that at the date of the Roman abdication the original
Celtic population would have dwindled down to an insignificant
number acting as serfs and tillers of the land, and not likely
to have much influence upon future generations. Mr. Hardwick,
in his History of Preston, writes:—“Few women would accompany
the Roman colonists, auxiliaries, and soldiers into Britain;
hence it is but rational to conclude, that during the long
period of their dominion, numerous intermarriages with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
native population would take place.” Admitting the force of
reasoning brought forward by the last authority, it can readily be
conceived that the purity of the aboriginal tribes would in a great
measure be destroyed at an early epoch, and that subsequent
alliances with the Anglo-Saxons, Danes, and Normans, have
rendered all conjectures as to the race of forefathers to which the
inhabitants of the Fylde have most claim practically valueless.</p>

<p>The dense forests with which our district in the earliest historic
periods abounded must have been well supplied with beasts of
chase, whereon the Aborigines exercised their courage and craft,
and from which their clothing and, in a great measure, their
sustenance were derived. The large branching horns of the
Wild Deer have been found in the ground at Larbrick, and during
the excavations for the North Union and East Lancashire Railway
Bridges over the Ribble, in 1838 and 1846 respectively, numerous
remains of the huge ox, called the <i>Bos primigenius</i>, and
the <i>Bos longifrons</i>, or long-faced ox, as well as of wild boars
and bears, were raised from beneath the bed of the river,
so that it is extremely likely that similar relics of the brute
creation are lying deeply buried in our soil. Such a supposition
is at least warranted by the discovery, half-a-century ago, of
the skull and short upright horns of a stag and those of an
ox, of a breed no longer known, at the bottom of a marl pit
near Rossall. Bones and sculls, chiefly those of deer and oxen,
have been taken from under the peat in all the mosses, and two
osseous relics, consisting each of skull and horns, of immense
specimens of the latter animal, have been dug up at Kirkham.
In the “Reliquiæ Diluvianæ” of Mr. Buckland is a figure of
the scull of a rhinoceros belonging to the antediluvian age, and
stated to have been discovered beneath a moss in Lancashire.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">When the battle of Hastings, in 1066, had terminated in
favour of William the Conqueror, and placed him on
the throne of England, he indulged his newly acquired
power in many acts of tyranny towards the vanquished
nation, subjecting the old nobility to frequent indignities,
weakening the sway of the Church, and impoverishing the middle
and lower classes of the community. This harsh policy spread
dissatisfaction and indignation through all ranks of the people,
and it was not long before rebellion broke out in the old province
of Northumbria. The Lancastrians and others, under the earls
Morcar and Edwin, rose up in revolt, slew the Norman Baron set
over them, and were only reduced to order and submission when
William appeared on the scene at the head of an overwhelming
force. The two earls escaped across the frontier to Scotland, and
for some inexplicable reason were permitted to retain their possessions
in Lancashire and elsewhere, while the common insurgents
were afterwards treated with great severity and cruelty by their
Norman rulers. Numerous castles were now erected in the north
of England to hold the Saxons in subjection, and guard against
similar outbreaks in future. Those at Lancaster and Liverpool
were built by a Norman Baron of high position, named Roger de
Poictou, the third son of Robert de Montgomery, earl of Arundel
and Shrewsbury. When William divided the conquered territory
amongst his followers, the Honor<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> of Lancaster and the Hundred<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
of Amounderness fell, amongst other gifts, amounting in all to
three hundred and ninety-eight manors,<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> to that nobleman, and,
as he resided during a large portion of his time at the castle
erected on the banks of the Lune, our district would receive a
greater share of attention than his more distant possessions.</p>

<p>After the country had been restored to peace, William determined
to institute an inquiry into the condition and resources of
his kingdom. The records of the survey were afterwards bound
up in two volumes, which received the name of the Domesday
Book, from <i>Dome</i>, a census, and <i>Boc</i>, a book.</p>

<p>The king’s commands to the investigators were, according to
the Saxon Chronicle, to ascertain—“How many hundreds of
hydes were in each shire, what lands the king himself had, and
what stock there was upon the land; or what dues he ought to
have by the year from each shire. Also he commissioned them
to record in writing, how much land his archbishops had and his
diocesan bishops, and his abbots and his earls; what or how much
each man had, who was an occupier of land in England, either in
land or stock, and how much money it was worth. So very
narrowly, indeed, did he commission them to trace it out, that
there was not one single hide, nor a yard of land; nay, moreover
(it is shameful to tell, though he thought it no shame to do it),
not even an ox, nor a cow, nor a swine, was there left that was
not set down in his writ.” The examination was commenced in
1080, and six years afterwards the whole of the laborious task was
accomplished. In this compilation the county of Lancaster is
never once mentioned by name, but the northern portion is joined
to the Yorkshire survey, and the southern to that of Cheshire.</p>

<p>The following is a translation of that part of Domesday Book
relating to the Fylde:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Agemundernesse under Evrvic—scire (Yorkshire).</span></p>

<p><i>Poltun</i> (Poulton), two carucates;<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> <i>Rushale</i> (Rossall), two carucates; <i>Brune</i> (Burn),

<p><i>Biscopham</i> (Bispham), eight carucates; <i>Latun</i> (Layton), six carucates.</p>

<p><i>Chicheham</i> (Kirkham), four carucates; <i>Salewic</i> (Salwick), one carucate; <i>Cliftun</i>
(Clifton), two carucates; <i>Newtune</i> (Newton-with-Scales), two carucates; <i>Frecheltune</i>
(Freckleton), four carucates; <i>Rigbi</i> (Ribby-with-Wray), six carucates; <i>Treueles</i>

(Singleton), six carucates; <i>Greneholf</i> (Greenhalgh), three carucates; <i>Hameltune</i>
(Hambleton), two carucates.</p>

<p><i>Lidun</i> (Lytham), two carucates.</p>

<p><i>Michelescherche</i> (St. Michael’s-on-Wyre), one carucate; <i>Pluntun</i> (Wood Plumpton)
five carucates; <i>Rodecliff</i> (Upper Rawcliffe), two carucates; <i>Rodecliff</i> (Middle

<i>Eglestun</i> (Ecclestons), two carucates; <i>Edeleswic</i> (Elswick), three carucates; <i>Inscip</i>
(Inskip), two carucates; <i>Sorbi</i> (Sowerby), one carucate.</p>

<p>All these vills belong to <i>Prestune</i> (Preston); and there are three churches (in
Amounderness). In sixteen of these vills<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> there are but few inhabitants—but how
many there are is not known.</p>

<p>The rest are waste. <i>Roger de Poictou</i> had [the whole].</p>

</div>

<p>When we read the concluding remark—“The rest are waste,”
and observe the insignificant proportion of the many thousands
of acres comprised in the Fylde at that time under cultivation, we
are made forcibly cognizant of the truly deplorable condition to
which the district had been reduced by ever-recurring warfare
through a long succession of years. There is no guide to the
number of the inhabitants, excepting, perhaps, the existence of
only three churches in the whole Hundred of Amounderness, and
this can scarcely be admitted as certain evidence of the paucity of
the population, as in the harassed and unsettled state in which
they lived it is not very probable that the people would be much
concerned about the public observances of religious ceremonials or
services. The churches alluded to were situated at Preston, Kirkham,
and St. Michael’s-on-Wyre. The parish church at Poulton
was the next one erected, and appears to have been standing less
than ten years after the completion of the Survey, for Roger de
Poictou, when he founded the priory of St. Mary, Lancaster, in
1094, endowed it with—“Pulton in Agmundernesia, and whatsoever
belonged to it, and the <i>church</i>, with one carucate of land,
and all other things belonging to it.”<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> The terminal paragraph<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
of the foundation-charter of the monastery states that Geoffrey,
the sheriff, having heard of the liberal grants of Roger de Poictou,
also bestowed upon it—“the tithes of Biscopham, whatever he
had in Lancaster, some houses, and an orchard.” It is difficult to
determine whether a church existed in the township of Bispham
at that date or not, but as no such edifice is included in the above
list of benefactions, we are inclined to believe that it was not
erected until later. The earliest mention of it occurs in the reign
of Richard I., 1189 to 1199, when Theobald Walter quitclaimed
to the abbot of Sees “all his right in the advowson of Pulton,
with the <i>church of Biscopham</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>The rebellious and ungrateful conduct of Roger de Poictou
ultimately led to his banishment out of the country, and the
forfeiture of the whole of his extensive possessions to the crown.
The Hundred of Amounderness was conveyed by the King on the
22nd of April, 1194, being the fifth year of his reign, to Theobald
Walter, the son of Hervens, a Norman who had accompanied the
Conqueror. “Be it known,” says the document, “that we give
and confirm to Theobald Walter the whole of Amounderness with
its appurtenances by the service of three Knights’ fees, namely,
all the domain thereto belonging, all the services of the Knights
who hold of the fee of Amounderness by Knight’s service, all the
service of the Free-tenants of Amounderness, all the Forest of
Amounderness, with all the Venison, and all the Pleas of the
Forest.” His rights “are to be freely and quietly allowed,”
continues the deed, “in wood and plain, in meadows and
pastures, in highways and footpaths, in waters and mills, in
mill-ponds, in fish-ponds and fishings, in peat-lands, moors and
marshes, in wreck of the sea, in fairs and markets, in advowsons
and chapelries, and in all liberties and free customs.” Amongst
the barons of Lancashire given in the MSS. of Percival is—“Theobald
Walter, baron of Weeton and Amounderness,” but, as
Weeton never existed as a barony, it is clear that the former title
is an error. The “Black Book of the Exchequer,” the oldest
record after the “Domesday Book,” has entered in it the tenants
and fees <i>de veteri feoffamento</i><a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and <i>de novo feoffamento</i>,<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> and
amongst others is a statement that Theobald Walter held<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
Amounderness by the service of one Knight, thus the later
charter, just quoted, must be regarded as a confirmation of a
previous grant, and not as an original donation. He was an
extensive founder of monastic houses, and amongst the abbeys
established by him was that of Cockersand, which he endowed
with the whole Hay of Pylin (Pilling) in Amounderness. He was
appointed sheriff of the county of Lancaster by Richard I. in 1194,
and retained the office until the death of that monarch five years
afterwards. His son, Theobald, married Maud, sister to the
celebrated Thomas à Becket, archbishop of Canterbury, and
assumed the title of his office when created <i>Chief Butler</i> of
Ireland. The family of the same name which inhabited Rawcliffe
Hall until that property was confiscated through the treasonable
part played by Henry Butler and his son Richard in the rebellion
of 1715, was directly descended from Theobald Walter-Butler.
The Butlers of Kirkland, the last of whom, Alexander Butler,
died in 1811, and was succeeded by a great-nephew, were also
representatives of the ancient race of Walter, and preserved the
line unbroken. Theobald Walter, the elder, died in 1206, and
Amounderness reverted to the crown.</p>

<p>Richard I. a few years before his death presented the Honor of
Lancaster to his brother, the earl of Moreton, who subsequently
became King John, and it is asserted that this nobleman, when
residing at the castle of Lancaster, was occasionally a guest at
Staining Hall, and that during one of his visits he so admired the
strength and skill displayed by a person called Geoffrey, and
surnamed the Crossbowman, that he induced him to join his
retinue. How far truth has been embellished and disguised by
fiction in this traditional statement we are unable to conjecture,
but there are reasonable grounds for believing that the story is
not entirely supposititious, for the earl of Moreton granted to
Geoffrey l’Arbalistrier, or the Crossbowman, who is said to have
been a younger brother of Theobald Walter, senior, six carucates
of land in Hackinsall-with-Preesall, and a little later, the manor
of Hambleton, most likely as rewards for military or other services
rendered to that nobleman. John, as earl of Moreton, appears to
have gained the affection and respect of the inhabitants of
Lancashire by his liberal practices during his long sojourns in
their midst. He granted a charter to the knights, thanes, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
freeholders of the county, whereby they and their heirs, without
challenge or interference from him and his heirs, were permitted
to fell, sell, and give, at their pleasure, their forest woods, without
being subject to the forest regulations, and to hunt and take
hares, foxes, rabbits, and all kinds of wild beasts, excepting stags,
hinds, roebucks, and wild hogs, in all parts within his forests
beyond the desmesne hays of the county.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> On ascending the
throne, however, he soon aroused the indignation of all sections of
his subjects by his meanness, pride, and utter inability to govern
the kingdom. His indolent habits excited the disgust of a
nobility, whose regular custom was to breakfast at five and dine
at nine in the morning, as proclaimed by the following popular
Norman proverb:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Lever à cinque, dîner à neuf,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Souper à cinque, coucher à neuf,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fait vivre d’ans nonante et neuf.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Eventually his evil actions and foolish threats so incensed the
nation, that the barons, headed by William, earl of Pembroke,
compelled him, in 1215, to sign the Magna Charta, a code of laws
embodying two important principles—the general rights of the
freemen, and the limitation of the powers of both king and pope.</p>

<p>About that time it would have been almost, if not quite,
impossible to have decided or described what was the national
language of the country. The services at the churches were read
in Latin, the aristocracy indulged only in Norman-French, whilst
the great mass of the people spoke a language, usually
denominated Saxon or English, but which had been so mutilated
and altered by additions from various sources that the ancient
“Settlers on the shores of the German Ocean” would scarcely
have recognized it as their native tongue. Each division of the
kingdom had its peculiar dialect, very much as now, and from the
remarks of a southern writer, named Trevisa, it must be inferred
that the <i>patois</i> of our own district, which he would include in the
old province of Northumbria,<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> was far from either elegant or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
musical. “Some,” he says, “use strange gibbering, chattering,
waffling, and grating; then the Northumbre’s tongue is so sharp,
flitting, floyting, and unshape, that we Southron men may not
understand that language.” Such a list of curious and
uncomplimentary epithets inclines us at first sight to doubt the
strict impartiality of their author, but when it is remembered that,
in spite of the greatly increased opportunities for education and
facilities for intercommunion amongst the different classes, the
provincialisms of some of our own peasantry would be utterly
unintelligible to many of us at the present day, we are constrained
to admit that Trevisa may have had just reason for his remarks.</p>

<p>In 1268 the Honor of Lancaster, the Wapentake of
Amounderness, and the manors of Preston, Ribby-with-Wray,
and Singleton were given by Henry III. to his son Edmund
Crouchback, and in addition the king published an edict
forbidding the sheriffs of neighbouring counties to enter
themselves, or send, or permit their bailiffs to enter or interfere
with anything belonging to the Honor of Lancaster, or to the men
of that Honor, unless required to do so by his son. Edmund was
also created earl of Lancaster, and became the founder of that
noble house, whose possessions and power afterwards attained to
such magnitude as to place its representative, Henry IV., upon the
throne, although nearer descendants of his grandfather Edward III.
were still living.</p>

<p>We have now arrived at the unsettled era, comprising the
reigns of the three Edwards and Richard II., and during the
whole of the time these monarchs wore the crown, a period of one
hundred and twenty-six years, the nation was engaged in
continual wars—with the Welsh under Llewellyn, the Scotch
under Bruce and Wallace, and the French under Philip. The
reign of Richard II. was additionally agitated by the insurrection
of Wat Tyler. Looking at that long uninterrupted season of
excitement, we cease to wonder at the riotous and disorganized
state into which society was thrown. The rulers, whether local
and subordinate, or those of a higher grade, were too actively
engaged in forwarding the efficiency of the army, to devote much
attention to the welfare and proper government of the people.
Crimes and disturbances were allowed to pass unpunished, and
evil-doers, being thus encouraged to prosecute their unlawful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
purposes, carried their outrages to the very confines of open
rebellion against all power and order. It was not until such a
dangerous climax had been reached that a commission, consisting
of the following judges, Peter de Bradbate, Edmund Deyncourt,
William de Vavasour, John de Island, and Adam de Middleton,
was appointed to deal summarily and severely with all offenders
in the counties of Lancaster and Westmoreland. During those
troublesome times Sir Adam Banastre and a number of others
assaulted Ralph de Truno, prior of Lancaster, and his train of
attendants at Poulton-le-Fylde, seized and carried him off to
Thornton, where they brutally ill-used and finally imprisoned
him. An inquiry into the disgraceful proceeding was instituted
by order of Edward I., but the result has not been preserved, at
least no record of it has as yet been discovered amongst any of the
ancient documents concerning this county. Leyland, who was
antiquary to Henry VIII., alluding to the death of the disorderly
knight, says,—“Adam Banastre, a bachelar of Lancastershire,
moved ryot agayne Thomas of Lancaster by kraft of kynge
Edward II., but he was taken and behedid by the commandment
of Thomas of Lancaster.” The first part of the quotation has
reference to a quarrel between the earl of Lancaster and Sir
Adam, who for his own aggrandizement and to curry favour with
the king, as well as to divert the attention of that monarch from
his own misdeeds, declared that Thomas of Lancaster wished to
interfere with the royal prerogative in the choice of ministers;
and, professedly, to punish such presumption he invaded the
domains of that nobleman. An encounter took place in
the valley of the Ribble, not far from Preston, in which the
followers of Sir Adam were vanquished and put to flight. Their
leader secreted himself in a barn on his own lands, but, being
discovered by the soldiers of his opponent, was dragged forth and
beheaded with a sword. Subjoined is an account of a disturbance
which occurred at Kirkham during the same period, transcribed
from the Vale Royal<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> register:—“A narrative of proceedings in a
dispute between the abbot of Vale Royal, and Sir Will. de Clifton,
knt., respecting the tithes in the manor of Clifton and Westby, in
the parish of Kirkham, A.D. 1337, in the time of Peter’s abbacy.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
The charges alleged against Sir William state, that he had
obtained twenty marks<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> due to the abbot; had forcibly obstructed
the rector in the gathering of tithes within the manor of Clifton
and Westby; seized his loaded wain, and brought ridicule on his
palfrey: that he had also burst, with his armed retainers, into the
parish church of Kirkham, and thereby deterred his clerks from
the performance of divine service; had prevented the parishioners
from resorting to the font for the rite of baptism; and that,
having seized on Thomas, the clerk of the abbot of Vale Royal,
he had inflicted on him a flagellation in the public streets of
Preston. After a complaint, made to the abbot of Westminster, a
conservator of the rights and privileges of the order to which
Vale Royal belonged, Sir William confessed his fault and threw
himself on the mercy of the abbot of the Cheshire convent, who
contented himself, after receiving a compensation for his rector’s
losses, with an oath from the refractory knight, that he would in
future maintain and defend the privileges of the abbey, and would
bind himself in forty shillings to offer no further violence to the
unfortunate secretary of the abbot.”</p>

<p>During the reign of Edward III., Henry, earl of Lancaster, was
created duke of the county with the consent of the prelates and
peers assembled in parliament. This nobleman, whose pious and
generous actions earned for him the title of the “Good duke of
Lancaster,” received a mandate from the king during the war with
France, when there were serious apprehensions of an invasion by
that nation, to arm all the lancers on his estates, and to set a strict
watch over the seacoasts of Lancashire. These precautions,
however, proved unnecessary, as the French made no attempt to
cross the channel. In his will, bearing the date 1361, (the year of
his death), Duke Henry bequeathed the Wappentakes or Hundreds
of Amounderness, Lonsdale, and Leyland, with other estates, to
his daughter Blanche, who had married John of Gaunt, the earl
of Richmond and fourth son of Edward III. John of Gaunt
succeeded to the dukedom in right of his wife.</p>

<p>“In the ‘Testa de Nevill’,” a register extending from 1274 to
1327, and containing, amongst other matters, a list of the fees and
serjeanties holden of the king and the churches in his gift, it is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
stated under the latter heading:—“St. Michael upon Wyre; the
son of Count Salvata had it by gift of the present king, and he
says, that he is elected into a bishoprick, and that the church is
vacant, and worth 30 marks<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> per an. Kyrkeham; King John
gave two parts of it to Simon Blundel, on account of his custody
of the son and heir of Theobald Walter. Worth 80 marks<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> per
an.” In another part of these records it is named that Richard de
Frekelton held fees in chief in Freckleton, Newton, and
Eccleston; Alan de Singilton, in Singleton, Freckleton, Newton,
and Elswick; and Adam de Merton, in Marton; also that Fitz
Richard held serjeanties in Singleton, by serjeanty of
Amounderness.</p>

<p>The earliest intimation of members being returned to represent
our own district, in conjunction with the other divisions of the
county, is to the parliament of Edward I., assembled in 1295,
when Matthew de Redmand and John de Ewyas were elected
knights of the shire for Lancaster, and in his report the sheriff
adds—“There is no city in the county of Lancaster.” The
members of parliament in 1297 were Henricus de Kigheley and
Henricus le Botyler; in 1302 Willielmus de Clifton and
Gilbertus de Singleton; and in 1304 Willielmus de Clifton and
Willielmus Banastre. Henricus le Botyler, or Butler, belonged
to the family of the Butlers of Rawcliffe; Gilbertus de Singleton was
probably connected with the Singletons whose descendants
resided at Staining Hall; Willielmus de Clifton was an ancestor
of the Cliftons of Lytham, and here it may be stated that
Lancashire was represented in 1383 by Robt. de Clifton, of
Westby, and Ric’us de Hoghton; and in 1844 by J. Wilson
Patten, now Lord Winmarleigh, and Jno. Talbot Clifton, esq., of
Lytham Hall. Thos. Henry Clifton, esq., son of the last
gentleman, and the Hon. F. A. Stanley are the present members
for North Lancashire.</p>

<p>During the Scottish wars of Edward III., John de Coupland, of
Upper Rawcliffe, valiantly captured David II., king of Scotland,
at the battle of Durham, and although that monarch dashed out
Coupland’s teeth and used every means to incite the latter to slay
him, the brave soldier restrained his wrath and delivered up his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
prisoner alive. For that signal service Edward rewarded him
with a grant of £500 per annum, until he could receive an
equivalent in land wherever he might choose, and created him a
knight banneret.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> “I have seen,” says Camden, “a charter of
King Edward III., by which he advanced John Coupland to the
state of a banneret in the following words, because in a battle
fought at Durham he had taken prisoner David the Second, King
of Scots:—‘Being willing to reward the said John, who took
David de Bruis prisoner, and frankly delivered him unto us, for
the deserts of his honest and valiant service, in such sort as others
may take example by his precedent to do us faithful service in
time to come, we have promoted the said John to the place and
degree of a banneret; and, for the maintenance of the same state,
we have granted, for us and our heirs, to the same John, five
hundred pounds by the year, to be received by him and his heirs’,”
etc.</p>

<p>For some time after a truce had been concluded with Scotland,
the war, in which the incident narrated occurred, continued with
little abatement, and in 1322 this county with others was called
upon to raise fresh levies. These constant drains upon its
resources, and the devastations committed by riotous companies
of armed men, so impoverished our district that the inhabitants of
Poulton forwarded a petition to the Pope, praying him to forego
his claims upon their town on account of the deplorably distressed
condition to which they had been reduced. The taxations of all
churches in the Fylde were greatly lowered in consideration of the
indigency of the people; that of Kirkham from 240 marks per
annum to 120, and the others in like proportion. Further
evidence of the poverty of this division may be gathered from a
census taken in 1377, which states, amongst other things, that—“There
is no town worthy of notice anywhere in the whole of the
county”; and again, twenty years later, when a loan was raised
to meet the enormous expenditure of the country, Lancashire
furnished no contributors.</p>

<p>In 1389, during the reign of Richard II., it was enacted, with a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
view to the preservation and improvement of the salmon fisheries
throughout the kingdom, “that no young salmon be taken or
destroyed by nets, at mill-dams or other places, from the middle
of April to the Nativity of St. John Baptist”; and special
reference is made to this neighbourhood in the following sentence
of the bill:—“It is ordained and assented, that the waters of Lone,
Wyre, Mersee, Ribbyl, and all other waters in the county of
Lancaster, be put in defence, as to the taking of Salmons, from
Michaelmas Day to the Purification of our Lady (2nd of February),
and in no other time of the year, because that salmons be not
seasonable in the said waters in the time aforesaid; and in the
parts where such rivers be, there shall be assigned and sworn good
and sufficient conservators of this statute.” The foregoing is the
earliest regulation of the kind, and the wisdom and utility of its
provisions are evinced by the existence of similar measures at the
present day.</p>

<p>From the annals of the Duchy may be learnt some interesting
particulars relative to changes in ownership at that period of
certain portions of the territory comprised in the Fylde. In 1380
John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster, issued a “precept to the
Escheator to give seisin of the Lands of William Botyler in
Layton Magna, Layton Parva, Bispham, Warthebrek, and Great
Merton,” etc.; and shortly afterwards gave orders to “seize the
Lands of William Botyler.” In 1385 mandates were issued by
the same nobleman to his Escheator to “seize into the Hands of
the King and himself the Lands of Thomas Banastre, (deceased,
1384), in Ethelswyk, Frekculton, Claughton in Amoundernes,
Syngleton Parva, Hamylton, Stalmyn,” etc.; also those of
“Emund Banastre, (deceased, 1384), in Wodeplumpton, Preston,”
etc. In the Rolls the subjoined entries also occur:—</p>

<p>There is nothing of interest or importance to recount affecting
the Fylde from the death of Richard II. until the year 1455, when
the battle of St. Albans, resulting in the defeat of Henry VI. and
the royal forces by the Duke of York, initiated those lamentable
struggles between the rival houses of York and Lancaster; and
the inhabitants of our section shared, like the rest, in the ruin and
bloodshed of civil war. Those contests, which lasted no less than
thirty years, and included thirteen pitched battles, were finally
terminated in 1485, by the union of Henry VII. with Catherine of
York, daughter of Edward IV.</p>

<p>In 1485 a malady called the “Sweating Sickness” visited the
different districts of Lancashire, and so rapid and fatal were the
effects, that during the seven weeks it prevailed, large numbers
of the populace fell victims to its virulence. Lord Verulam,
describing the disease, says:—“The complaint was a pestilent
fever, attended by a malign vapour, which flew to the heart and
seized the vital spirits; which stirred nature to strive to send it
forth by an extreme sweat.”</p>

<p>In 1487 the impostor Lambert Simnel, who personated Edward,
earl of Warwick, the heir in rightful succession to Edward IV.,
landed at the Pile of Fouldrey, (Peel harbour) in Morecambe Bay,
with an army raised chiefly by the aid of the Duchess of Burgundy,
and marched into the country. At Stoke, near Newark, he was
defeated and taken prisoner, and subsequently the adventurer
was made a scullion in the king’s kitchen, from which humble
sphere he rose by good conduct to the position of falconer.
Henry VIII., soon after his accession in 1509, became embroiled
in war with France, and whilst he was engaged in hostilities on
the continent, James IV. of Scotland crossed the border, and
invaded England with a force of fifty thousand men. To resist
this aggression large levies were promptly raised in Lancashire
and other northern counties, and on the field of Flodden, in
Northumberland, a decisive battle took place in 1513, in which
the Scottish monarch was slain, and his army routed. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
Lancashire troops were led by Sir Edward Stanley, and their
patriotism and valour are celebrated in an ancient song called the
“Famous Historie or Songe of Floodan Field.” In the following
extract certain localities in and near the Fylde are mentioned as
having furnished their contingents of willing soldiers:—</p>

<p>It may be here noticed that Edmund Dudley, so notorious in
English history as the infamous agent of Henry VII. in the
wholesale and scandalous extortions that monarch practised upon
his subjects, held many and large territorial possessions in the
county of Lancashire, the reward in all probability of his
unscrupulous services to the king. After the death of his royal
patron a loud outcry for the punishment of Dudley was raised by
the nation, and in the first year of Henry VIII. a proclamation
was issued inviting those subjects who had been injured by
Dudley and his fellow commissioner, Sir Richard Empson, to
come forward and state their complaints; the number of
complainants who appeared was so great that it was found
impossible to examine all their claims, so in order to pacify the
universal indignation, the two obnoxious agents were thrown into
prison on a charge of treason. From the Inquisition for the
Escheat of the Duchy of Lancaster taken on the attainder of
Edmund Dudley, in 1509, it is discovered that amongst his
numerous estates, were lands in Elswick, Hambleton, Freckleton,
Thornton, Little Singleton, Wood Plumpton, Whittingham,
Goosnargh, and Claughton. Stow, writing about the circumstances
alluded to, says:—“Thereupon was Sir Richard Empson,
Knight, and Edmund Dudley, Esquire, by a politicke mean
brought into the Tower, where they were accused of treason, and
so remained there prisoners, thereby to quiet men’s minds, that
made such suit to have their money restored. On the seventeenth
of July Edmund Dudley was arraigned in the Guildhall of
London, where he was condemned, and had judgement to be
drawn, hanged, and quartered.... Henry VIII. sent
commandment to the Constable of the Tower, charging him that
Empson and Dudley should shortly after be put to execution.
The Sheriffs of London were commanded by a special writ to see
the said execution performed and done, whereupon they went to
the Tower and received the prisoners on the 17th of August, 1510,
and from thence brought them unto the scaffold on Tower Hill,
where their heads were stricken off.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span></p>

<p>The most conspicuous event which happened during the
sovereignty of Henry VIII. was the Protestant Reformation.
Henry, having quarrelled with the Supreme Head of the Church
at Rome, determined to suppress all religious houses in his
kingdom whose incomes amounted to less than £200 per annum.
Doctors Thomas Leigh and Thomas Layton were appointed to
inspect and report on those in Lancashire; and amongst the
number condemned on their visit was a small Benedictine Cell at
Lytham. This Cell owed its origin to Richard Fitz Roger, who
towards the latter part of the reign of Richard I. granted lands at
Lytham to the Durham Church, in order that a prior and
Benedictine monks might be established there to the honour of
St. Mary and St. Cuthbert. Its yearly revenue at the time of
suppression was only £55. A little later, in 1540, the larger
monastic institutions suffered the fate of the smaller ones; and
amongst the chantries closed were two at St. Michael’s-on-Wyre.
All Catholic places of worship were closed by a proclamation,
bearing the date September 23rd, 1548, and issued by the lord
protector Somerset on behalf of the young king Edward VI. On
the death of that monarch in 1553 the crown descended to his
sister Mary, only daughter of Catherine of Arragon; and one of
her first acts was to re-establish the old faith and re-open the
churches and chantries which her predecessors had closed. Mass
was again celebrated in the churches of St. Michael’s-on-Wyre,
Kirkham, and Singleton, as in former days, the officiating priests
being:—</p>

<p>Dodsworth, who lived in the latter part of the sixteenth and
early part of the seventeenth centuries, informs us that sometime
during the year 1555 “a sudden irruption of the sea” took place
near Rossall grange, and a whole village, called Singleton Thorp,
was washed away by the fury of the waves. “The inhabitants
were driven out of their ancient home, and erected their tents at a
place called Singleton to this day.” It has been surmised that
Singleton Thorp was the residence of Thomas de Singleton, who
opposed Edward I. in a suit to recover from that king the manors
of Singleton, Thornton, and Brughton. The site formerly
occupied by the ancient village is now called Singleton Skeer.
Dodsworth also declares that the Horse-bank lying off the shores
of Lytham was, in 1612, during the reign of James I., a pasture
for cattle, and that, in 1601, a village called Waddum Thorp
existed between it and the present main-land.</p>

<p>An epidemic, described by Hollinworth as a “sore sicknesse,”
prevailed in this county during some months of 1565, and carried
off many of the inhabitants.</p>

<p>Queen Elizabeth on her accession wrought another change in
the national religion, but taking warning from the outcries and
disturbances produced by the sudden and sweeping policies of
Henry VIII. and Mary, proceeded to affect her purpose in a more
deliberate manner. She retained some of her Catholic ministers,
taking care, however, to have sufficient of the reformed faith to
outvote them when occasion required, and appointed a commission
to inquire into the persecutions of the last reign, with orders to
liberate from prison all those who had been confined on account
of their attachment to Protestant principles. In her own chapel
she forbade several Popish practices, and commanded that certain
portions of the services should be read in the English tongue.
Shortly afterwards a proclamation was issued, ordering that all
chantries should conduct their services after the model of her
own chapel. This comparative moderation was succeeded at a
later period of her sovereignty by sterner measures, and many
Catholic recusants were placed in confinement, being subjected to
heavy penalties and degradations. During the same reign the
military strength of the nation was again ascertained by a general
muster. The gathering took place in 1574, when six gentlemen
of our neighbourhood were thus rated:—</p>

<p>Cuthbert Clifton, esq., to furnish:—Light horse 1, Plate-coate
1, Pyke 1, Long bows 2, Sheaves of arrows 2, Steel caps 2, Caliver
1, Morion 1.</p>

<p>James Massey, George Alane to furnish:—Plate-coat 1, Long
bow 1, Sheaf of arrows 1, Steel cap 1, Caliver 1, Morion 1, Bill 1.</p>

<p>William Hesketh to furnish of good will:—Caliver 1, Morion 1.</p>

<p>William Singleton, John Veale to furnish:—The same as
William Hesketh doth.</p>

<p>The whole complement raised in the Hundred of Amounderness
consisted of—5 Light horse, 1 Demi-lance, 2 Corslets, 17 Plate-coats,
11 Pykes, 22 Long bows, 22 Sheaves of arrows, 27 Steel
caps, 15 Calivers, 20 Morions, and 10 Bills.</p>

<p>Father Edmund Campion, the notorious Jesuit, was apprehended
in 1581, immediately after travelling through Lancashire
endeavouring to spread the doctrines of his faith, and imprisoned
in the Tower. Under the cruel influence of the rack he divulged
the names of several persons by whom he had been received and
entertained whilst on his journey, and amongst them were Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
Allen of Rossall Hall, the widow of Richard Allen, and John
Westby of Mowbreck and Burn Halls. Shortly before his
execution Campion deplored his compulsory confession in a letter
to a friend in these words:—“It grieved me much to have offended
the Catholic cause so highly, as to confess the names of some
gentlemen and friends in whose houses I have been entertained;
yet in this I greatly cherish and comfort myself, that I never
discovered any secrets there declared, and that I will not, come
rack, come rope.”</p>

<p>At that period it was customary to levy a tax of live stock and
different articles of food on each county, for the supply of the
royal larder, and Sir Richard Sherburn, of Carleton and
Hambleton, and Alexander Rigby, of Middleton, near Preston,<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
ratified an agreement with the treasurer and controller of
Elizabeth’s household, that Lancashire should provide annually<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
forty great oxen, to be delivered alive at her majesty’s pasture at
Crestow. Afterwards the sums to be contributed by each
Hundred for the purchase of these animals was arranged, and
Amounderness rated at £16 10s. 0d. per year. The latter agreement
was ratified by Sir Richard Sherburne and Edward Tyldesley,
of Myerscough, amongst others. Grievous complaints were made
in the Fylde and other parts of the county of the desecration of the
Sabbath by “Wakes, fayres, markettes, bayrebaytes, bull baits,
Ales, Maygames, Resortinge to Alehouses in tyme of devyne
service, pypinge and dauncinge, huntinge and all manner of
unlawfull gamynge.” A letter praying that these profanations
might be reformed was signed by the magistrates of the several
districts, amongst whom were Edmund Fleetwood of Rossall, and
R. Sherburne of Carleton, etc., and forwarded to London. A
commission of inquiry was appointed, and after an investigation,
the commissioners charged all mayors, bailiffs, and constables, as
well as other civil officers, churchwardens, etc., to suppress by all
lawful means the said disorders of the Sabbath, and to present the
offenders at the quarter sessions, that they might be dealt with for
the same according to law. They also directed that the minstrels,
bearwards, and all such disorderly persons, should be immediately
apprehended and brought before the justices of the peace, and
punished at their discretion; that the churchwardens should be
enjoined to present at the sessions all those that neglected to
attend divine service upon the Sabbath day, that they might be
indicted and fined in the penalty of twelve pence for every
offence; that the number of alehouses should be abridged, that
the ale-sellers should utter a full quart of ale for one penny, and
none of any less size, and that they should sell no ale or other
victuals in time of divine service; that none should sell ale
without a license; that the magistrates should be enjoined not to
grant any ale-licenses except in public sessions; that they should
examine the officers of the commonwealth to learn whether they
made due presentment at the quarter sessions of all bastards born
or remaining within their several precincts; and that thereupon a
strict course should be taken for the due punishment of the
reputed parents according to the statute, as also for the convenient
keeping and relief of the infants.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>In 1588, the year following the execution of Mary, Queen of
Scots, Philip of Spain, urged on by an ambition to conquer the
kingdom of England and re-establish the Romish religion,
equipped an immense fleet, consisting of seventy-two galliasses
and galleons, forty-seven second-class ships of war, and eleven
pinnaces, to which he gave the name of the “Invincible Armada.”
The rumour of this invasion spread great alarm throughout the
country; and the magistrates, gentry, and freeholders of Lancashire
were summoned to meet Lord Strange at Preston, to consider
what steps should be taken for the defence of their coast, on
which, at Peel in Morecambe Bay, it was deemed probable the
Spaniards would attempt a landing. So doubtful does Elizabeth
appear to have been of the loyalty of her Lancashire subjects that
Lord Strange was commanded to append to his summonses the
words,—“Fayle not at your uttermost peril.” Nor were these
suspicions on the part of the queen without good reason, for the
principal landed proprietors and gentry of the county were
members of the Romish Church, and it was to be feared that they
would be only lukewarm in repelling, if not, indeed, active in
encouraging, an enemy whose professed object was the restoration
of their religion. Baines, in reviewing the Reformation, says,—“In
the county of Lancashire it was retrograde. The Catholics
multiplied, priests were harboured, the book of common prayer
and the service of the Church, established by law, were laid aside;
many of the churches were shut up, and the cures unsupplied,
unless by the ejected Catholics.” Numerous crosses on the
highways, as well as the names of several places, as Low-cross,
High-cross, Norcross, etc., also testify to the Romish tendency of
the inhabitants. Cardinal Allen, who had for many years been
living on the continent at Douai and elsewhere<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> was suspected
of having, in conjunction with Parsons, the Jesuit, instigated
Philip to this invasion. The harbour of “Pille,” (Peel) is
described in the Lansdowne manuscripts as the “very best haven
for landings with great shyppes in all the west coast of England,
called St. George’s Channel,” and further in the same folio we
read:—“What the Spanyerd means to do the Lord knows, for all
the countrie being known to Doctor Allen, who was born harde by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
the pyle,” (Rossall Hall was the birth-place of Allen,) “and the
inhabytentes ther aboutes all ynfected with the Romish poyson,
it is not unlike that his directione will be used for some landinge
there.... One Thomas Prestone (a papyshe atheiste) is
deputye steward, and commandes the menrede, and lands ther,
wch were sometyme appertayning to the Abbeye of Fornes.”</p>

<p>Whilst preparations for resisting the Spaniards were being
pushed forward with as much expedition as possible, the
“Invincibles” appeared in the English Channel, and arranged
themselves for battle in the form of a crescent. The British fleet,
numbering only thirty-four ships of war, and sundry private
vessels equipped for the occasion, under the command of Lord
Howard, sailed out to engage them. A series of actions took
place, and although nothing decisive had been effected, the
advantage seemed to be leaning towards the English fleet, when
eight fire-ships drifted in amongst the Armada and threw them
into utter confusion. This <i>coup de maître</i> took place on the 29th
of July, 1588. The panic-stricken Spaniards, fearing that the
whole of their ships would be destroyed in a general conflagration,
severed their cables, and fled. A westerly gale, however, sprang
up, and wrecked many of the vessels on the coast between Ostend
and Calais; the shores of Scotland and Ireland were also covered
with fragments of their ships and bodies of their mariners, while
tradition asserts that one of the galleons was stranded on the Point
of Rossall, where it was attacked by the country people, either for
the sake of pillage or in the hope of capturing it. Whether one
or both of these desires actuated the rustics they were doomed to
disappointment, for the Spaniards successfully resisted their first
attempt, and escaped on the returning tide, before further efforts
could be made by the little band on shore. Two cannon balls
were formerly to be seen at Rossall Hall, and it was stated that
they were the identical ones fired by this vessel, as a parting
salute, when she sailed away. They were found on removing
some of the walls belonging to the old mansion.</p>

<p>The dress of the priests previous to the Protestant Reformation is
thus described by Harrison:—“They went either in divers colours
like plaiers, or in garments of light hew, as yellow, red, greene,
etc., with their shoes piked, their haire crisped, and their girdles
armed with silver; their shoes, spurs, bridles, etc., buckled with
like mettall; their apparell chiefly of silke, and richlie furred,
their cappes laced and buttoned with gold; so that to meet a
priest in those days, was to beholde a peacocke that spreadeth his
taile when he danseth before the henne.” “The manners and
customs of the inhabitants of Lancashire,” writes John de
Brentford, “are similar to those of the neighbouring counties
except that the people eat with two pronged forks<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>; the men are
masculine, and in general well made, they ride and hunt the same
as in the most southern parts, but not with that grace, owing to
the whip being carried in the left hand; the women are most
handsome, their eyes brown, black, hazel, blue, or grey; their
noses, if not inclined to the aquiline, are mostly of the Grecian
form, which gives a most beautiful archness to the countenance,
such indeed as is not easy to be described, their fascinating
manners have long procured them the name of Lancashire
witches.” Leyland in his “Itinerary” says:—“The dress of the
men chiefly consists of woollen garments, while the women wear
those of silk, linen, or stuff. Their usual colours are those of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
green, blue, black, and sometimes brown. The military are
dressed in red, which is vulgarly called scarlet.” In the time of
Henry VIII. the custom of placing chimneys on the tops of the
houses was first introduced amongst the English; before that
period the smoke usually found its way through an opening in the
roof or out of the doorway. The houses of the middle classes
were for the most part formed of wood, whilst those of the
peasantry were built of wattles plastered over with a thick
coating of clay. The few stone mansions existing in Lancashire
were the residences of the nobility or of the most opulent gentry.
Harrison, referring to the improvements in accommodation
gradually gaining ground, remarks:—“There was a great,
although not general, amendment of lodging; for our fathers,
yea, and we ourselves also, have lien full oft upon straw pallets,
on rough mats, onelie covered with a sheet under coverlets made
of dagswam or hopparlots, and a good round log under the head
instead of a bolster or pillow, which was thought meet onelie for
women in childbed; as for servants, if they had anie sheets above
them, it was well, for seldome had they anie under their bodies to
keep them from the prickly straws that ran oft through the
canvas of the pallet, and raised their hardened hides.” Holinshed,
also, notices the better style of entertainment at the inns of
Lancaster, Preston, etc.; at which he tells us the guests were well
provided with “napierie, bedding, and tapisserie,” and each was
sure of resting “in cleane sheets wherein no man had been lodged
since they came from the laundress.” Camden, writing of our
more immediate neighbourhood a little later than the period we
are now discussing, says:—“The goodly and fresh complexion of
the natives does sufficiently evince the goodness of the county;
nay and the cattle too, if you will; for in the oxen, which have
huge horns and proportionate bodies, you will find nothing of that
perfection wanting that Mago, the Carthagenian, in Columella
required. This soil (Amounderness) bears oats pretty well, but is
not so good for barley; it makes excellent pasture especially
towards the sea, where it is partly Champain; whence a great
part of it is called the File, probably for the Field. But being in
other places Fenny ’tis reckoned less wholesome. In many places
along the coast there are heaps of sand, upon which the natives
now and then pour water, till it grows saltish, and then with turf<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
boyl it into white salt.” Several of these salt manufacturies were
located near Lytham, and it is very likely that the two brass pans
and an ancient measure, discovered about forty years since deeply
imbedded in the peat not far from Fox Hall, were used in the
production of salt somewhere in that vicinity.</p>

<p>A custom prevailed in former days of relieving the secular
portion of the community by imposing exclusive taxes on the
clergy, and hence it is seen, that in 1608 a rate was levied upon
the latter by the Right Reverend George Lloyd, D.D., the eighth

<p>Here it may be mentioned that, although about 636, Honorus,
archbishop of Canterbury, attempted to divide the kingdom into
parishes, it was not until many years later, in the reign of Henry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
VIII., that the diocese to which Lancashire belonged was clearly
defined. At that date Chester was created a distinct bishopric,
and the southern part of our county included in the archdeaconry
of Chester, whilst the northern portion was attached to the
archdeaconry of Richmond.</p>

<p>In 1617 James I., on his return journey from Scotland to
London, was entertained at Myerscough Lodge, near Garstang, by
Edward Tyldesley, the grandfather of the gentleman who erected
Fox Hall, at Blackpool. Thomas Tyldesley, a cousin of the owner
of Myerscough Lodge, and attorney-general of the county of
Lancaster, had been knighted by the monarch at Wimbleton in
the previous year. From Myerscough the King proceeded to
Hoghton Tower, where a petition was presented to him by the
agricultural labourers, petty tradesmen, and ordinary servants in
this and other districts lying near Preston, praying that the edict
of the late queen, whereby sports and games had been prohibited
on the Sabbath, might be repealed. The prayer of the petitioners
found favour with James, and shortly afterwards he caused it to
be proclaimed—“that his majesty’s pleasure was, that the bishops
of the diocese should take strict order with all the puritans and
precisians within the county of Lancaster, and either constrain
them to conform themselves, or to leave the countrie, according
to the laws of this kingdom and the canons of the church; and
for his good people’s recreation his pleasure was, that after the
end of divine service, they be not disturbed, letted, or discouraged
from any lawful recreation, such as dancing, either men or women;
archery for men, leaping, vaulting, or any such harmless
recreation; nor having of May-games, Whitson-ales, and Morice-dances,
and the setting up of May-poles, and other sports
therewith used; so as the same be had in due and convenient
time, without impediment or neglect of divine service; and that
women should have leave to carry rushes to the church, for
decorating of it according to the old custom; but withal his
majesty did here account still as prohibited, all unlawful games to
be used on Sundays only, as bear and bull-baitings, interludes,
and, at all times, in the meaner sort of people, by law prohibited,
bowling.” A few months after this concession to the wishes of a
portion of his subjects, James issued a publication designated the
“Book of Sports,” in which he explained what were to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
considered lawful sports to be indulged in on “Sundays and
Festivals.”</p>

<p>In the Registers of Kirkham is the annexed statement, from
which it appears that a few years from the death of James I. the
Fylde, or at least a considerable tract of it, was visited by some
fatal epidemic, but its peculiar nature cannot be ascertained:—“<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>
1630. This year was a great plague in Kirkham, in which
the more part of the people of the town died thereof. It began
about the 25th of July and continued vehemently until Martinmas,
but was not clear of it before Lent; and divers towns of the parish
was infected with it, and many died thereof out of them, as
Treales, Newton, Greenall, Estbrick, Thistleton. N.B.—The
great mortality was in the year 1631; 304 died that year, and
were buried at Kirkham, of whom 193 in the months of August
and September”. Charles I. soon after ascending the throne in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
1626, provoked a breach with his parliament by endeavouring to
enforce subsidies, with which to carry on his foreign wars, and
further, he alienated the affections and respect of the Puritan
section of his subjects by confirming the regulations of the “Book
of Sports.” Dissatisfaction and murmurings were quickly
fermented into rebellion, and the closing of the gates of Hull
against the king in 1642 initiated those fearful wars, which
desolated and disorganised the country for so many years. In
1641, Alexander Rigby,<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> esq., of Layton Hall, Sir Gilbert de
Hoghton, with eight other gentlemen, were removed from the
commission of the peace, by order of parliament, on suspicion of
being favourably disposed towards the royal party. The chief
supporters of the king in the ensuing conflicts were the nobility,
in great numbers; the higher orders of the gentry, and a
considerable portion of their tenantry; all the High-churchmen;
and a large majority of the Catholics. The parliamentarian army,
on the other hand, was mainly composed of freeholders, traders,
manufacturers, Puritans, Presbyterians, and Independents. An
engagement near Wigan roused up the people in our vicinity to a
sense of the dangers menacing them, and a public meeting of
royalists was called at Preston under the presidency of the earl of
Derby. Amongst other gentlemen who took a prominent part
in the assembly were Thomas Clifton, esq., of Lytham, and
Alexander Rigby, esq., of Layton. Several resolutions were
adopted, the most important being that a sum of money,
amounting to £8,700, should be raised and devoted to the
payment of a regiment, consisting of 2,000 foot and 400 horse, in
the following scale of remuneration:—</p>

<p>Parliamentary commissioners were sent this year, 1642, into all
parts of Lancashire to visit the churches and chapels and to
remove therefrom all images, superstitious pictures, and idolatrous
relics, which any of them might contain.</p>

<p>Preston and Lancaster were amongst the earliest towns to fall
into the hands of the Roundheads, and about ten days after the
surrender of the former place, when the people of this district were
labouring under the excitement of war on their very frontier,
Alexander Rigby, of Layton Hall, accompanied by Captain
Thomas Singleton, of Staining, and other officers, appeared near
Poulton at the head of a number of horsemen, and threw the
inhabitants into a state of great consternation and alarm,
fortunately proving unnecessary, for the cavalcade had other
designs than that of bringing devastation and bloodshed to their
own doors, and continued their journey peaceably northward. A
few weeks later a Spanish vessel was seen at the entrance of
Morecambe Bay, off Rossall Point, and as it evinced no signs of
movement, either towards the harbour of Lancaster or out to sea,
the yeomen and farm servants of that neighbourhood at once
surmised that some sort of an invasive attack was meditated on
their coast, nor were these fears in any way allayed by the constant
firing of a piece of cannon from the deck of the ship, and it was
not until the discharges had been repeated through several days
that they realised that distress and not bombardment was intended
to be indicated. On boarding the vessel they found that she
contained a number of passengers, all of whom, together with the
crew, were reduced to a pitiable and enfeebled condition through
exposure and scarcity of provisions, for, having lost their way in the
heavy weather which prevailed, they had been detained much over
the time expected for the voyage, blindly cruising about in the
hope of discovering some friendly haven or guide. The craft was
piloted round into the mouth of the river Wyre, opposite the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
Warren, and relief afforded to the sufferers. Rumour of the
presence of the ship was not long in reaching the ears of the earl
of Derby, who, with promptitude determined to march down and
seize it in the king’s name. On the Saturday he arrived at
Lytham Hall with a small troop of cavalry, where he sojourned
for the night, with the intention of completing his journey and
effecting his purpose the following day before the parliamentarians
had got word of the matter; but here his calculations were at
fault, for the parliamentary leader had already dispatched four
companies of infantry, under Major Sparrow, to take possession of
the prize, and on the same Saturday evening they took up their
quarters at Poulton and Singleton, having arrived by a different
route to the earl, who had forded the river at Hesketh Bank. On
the Sunday Major Sparrow, who throughout showed a lively
horror of risking an encounter with the renowned nobleman,
posted scouts with orders to watch the direction taken by the
latter, and convey the information without delay to the chief
station at Poulton, where the soldiers were in readiness, not for
action, as it subsequently turned out, but to put a safe barrier
between themselves and the enemy, for no sooner was it ascertained
that the earl, “all his company having their swords drawn,”
was marching along Layton Hawes towards Rossall, than Sparrow
conducted his force across the Wyre, at the Shard, and followed the
course of the stream towards its outlet “until he came over
against where the shipp lay, being as feared of the earle as the
earle was of him.”<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> The earl of Derby advanced along the shore
line and across the Warren to the mouth of the river without the
naked weapons of his followers being called into service, but finding
when he boarded the ship that two parliamentary gentlemen
had forestalled his intention by seizing her for the powers they
recognized, he unhesitatingly took them prisoners, and set fire to
the vessel, whilst Sparrow and his men stood helplessly by, on the
opposite side of the water, where the gallant major perhaps congratulated
himself on his caution in having avoided a collision
with so prompt and vigorous a foe. Some of the Spaniards
attached themselves to the train of the earl, whilst others were
scattered over the neighbourhood, depending for subsistence upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
the charity of the cottagers and farmers, but their final destiny is
unknown. The noble general, enraged at the unlooked for frustration
of the main object of his journey, determined that it
should not be altogether fruitless, and on his return forced admittance
into the mansion of the Fleetwoods, at Rossall, and bore off
all the arms he could lay hands upon. Resuming his march he
re-passed through Lytham, forded the Ribble, and finally made
his way to Lathom House, his famous residence.</p>

<p>Inactivity, however temporary, was ill suited to the temperament
of the earl, and on receiving the news that the solitary piece
of artillery belonging to the luckless Spanish vessel had been
appropriated by the parliamentary officials before he appeared upon
the scene, and transferred to their stronghold at Lancaster, he
conceived the idea of reducing the ancient castle on the Lune, and
so taking vengeance on those who had anticipated him in the
Wyre affair, as well as removing a formidable obstacle to the
success of the royal arms. Before entering on an undertaking of
such importance it was necessary that his small body of troops
should be materially increased, and after exhausting the districts
south of the Ribble, he crossed it, in search of recruits amongst the
yeomanry and peasantry of the Fylde. The earl lodged his
soldiers in and about Kirkham, and fixed his own quarters at
Lytham Hall. Dreadful stories are related by the old historian,
from whose work we have already quoted, of the doings of the
troops for the short time they remained in the neighbourhood,
but it is only fair to state that their rapacity was directed exclusively
against the property of those whose sympathies were with
their opponents, whose houses and farms they plundered most
mercilessly, driving off their horses, and carrying away ornaments,
bedding, and everything which could either be turned to immediate
use or offered a prospect of future gain. Warrants were issued on
the first day of their arrival, from the head quarters at Lytham,
over the whole of our section, calling upon every male above sixteen
years of age and under sixty, “upon payne of death to appear
before his Honor at Kirkham the next morning by eight of the
clock, in their best weapons, to attend the King’s service.”<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> The
officers to whom fell the task of heralding the mandate over the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
large area in the brief interval allowed, fulfilled their duties with
energy, and a goodly company responded to the arbitrary summons
of the commander. After having seen that the fresh levies
were as suitably equipped for warfare as means would permit, the
earl appointed John Hoole, of Singleton, and John Ambrose, of
Wood Plumpton, as captains over them, and gave the order to
march. On reaching Lancaster Lord Derby summoned the
mayor and burgesses to surrender the town and castle into his
hands, to which the chief magistrate replied that the inhabitants
had already been deprived of their arms and were unresisting, but
that the fortress, now garrisoned by parliamentary troops, was out
of his keeping, an answer so far unsatisfactory to the besieger
that he set fire to the buildings, about one hundred and seventy
of which were destroyed, and inflicted other injury on the place.
Colonel Ashton, of Middleton, who had been sent to relieve the
castle, arrived too late, when the earl was some distance on his
return towards Preston, from which town he dislodged the enemy.
A little later the tide of fortune turned against the royalists, and
the earl of Derby was one of the earliest to suffer defeat. Colonel
Thomas Tyldesley, a staunch partizan of the king, and the father
of Edward Tyldesley, of Fox Hall, Blackpool, retreated before
Colonel Ashton, from Wigan to Lathom, and afterwards to Liverpool,
where he was besieged and forced again to fly by his indefatigable
opponent. (Later he distinguished himself at Burton-on-Trent,
by the desperate heroism with which he led a cavalry
charge over a bridge of thirty-six arches, and for that display of
valour as well as his faithful adherence to Charles, he received
the honour of knighthood.) Driven from Liverpool, Tyldesley,
in company with Lord Molyneux, withdrew the remnant of his
regiment towards the Ribble, crossed that stream, and quartered
his men in Kirkham, whilst Molyneux occupied the village of
Clifton. In these places they rested a night and a day, keeping a
vigilant look out for their pursuer, Ashton, from the old windmill,
situated at the east end of Kirkham. About one o’clock on the
day succeeding the evening of their arrival the soldiers, acting
under orders, repaired to their several lodgings to further refresh
themselves after their prolonged fatigues, but before four hours
had elapsed, a report came from the outpost that the enemy was
approaching. An alarm spread through the camp, and with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
difficulty Lord Molyneux and Colonel Tyldesley assembled their
forces in the town of Kirkham, where they elected once more to
make a stand against the victorious Ashton. Command was
given that all the women and children should confine themselves
within doors, and preparations were hurried forward to offer the
parliamentarians a vigorous resistance; but as daylight waned and
the besiegers were momentarily expected, the courage of the royal
troops seems to have oozed away, and they precipitately vacated
the town, fording the Wyre, and flying towards Stalmine, whence
they continued their retreat to Cockerham, and so on northwards.
When Colonel Ashton entered Kirkham he found the enemy
gone and the inhabitants in a state of extreme trepidation, but
their fears were soon dismissed by the action of the gallant soldier
who, on learning the course taken by Tyldesley and Molyneux,
pushed on without delay. Ashton followed up the pursuit as far
as the boundaries of Lancashire, without overtaking any of the
royalists, and then returned to Preston. The rear of his troops
diverged from the main road at Garstang, unknown to their
leader, and marched into the Fylde for plunder. They passed
through St. Michael’s, and visiting the residence and estate of
Christopher Parker, of Bradkirk, drove away many of his cattle,
and stripped his house of everything of value. In Kirkham they
laid the people under heavy toll, and even spared not those who
were notoriously well affected towards parliament. At Clifton
they found more herds of cattle, which were joined to those
already with them; but at Preston they fell to quarrelling over
the booty, and it is questionable whether their ill-gotten stores
did not prove rather a curse than a blessing to them.</p>

<p>Towards the end of 1643, the year in which the events just
narrated occurred, Thurland Castle, the seat of Sir John
Girlington, was captured by the parliamentary colonel, Alexander
Rigby, of Middleton, near Preston. In the engagement the
Lancashire troops were under the command of Alexander Rigby,
of Layton, who allowed his small regiment to be surprised and
routed by his namesake. After his success at Thurland, Colonel
Rigby, of Middleton, proceeded to raise fresh levies in Amounderness.
Mr. Clayton, of Fulwood Moor, was appointed to
superintend the whole of the recruiting and directed to place
himself at the head of the new regiment. Mr. Patteson, of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
Ribby, and Mr. Wilding, of Kirkham, were each apportioned half
of the parish bearing the latter name, in which they were
respectively ordered to raise a company. In the parishes of
Poulton and Bispham, Mr. Robert Jolly, of Warbreck, Mr.
William Hull, of Bispham, Mr. Richard Davis, of Newton, and
Mr. Rowland Amon, of Thornton, were made captains, and had
similar duties imposed upon them. In Lytham parish, Mr.
George Sharples, of Freckleton, received a commission, but was
unable to muster more than a very few followers, as the people of
that neighbourhood reflected the loyal sentiments of the lord of
the manor, and could neither be coerced nor seduced from their
allegiance to the king. Captains Richard Smith and George
Carter, of Hambleton, raised companies in Stalmine, Hambleton,
and the adjacent townships and villages. Mr. William Swarbrick
recruited a company in his native parish of St. Michael’s, and
Mr. Duddell obtained another in Wood Plumpton.</p>

<p>At the siege of Bolton, in May, 1644, when the town was
stormed and surrendered after a valiant resistance, to Prince Rupert,
with an army of over nine thousand royalists, Duddell and Davis
were amongst the officers slain, whilst their companies were
literally cut to pieces. Captain George Sharples, of Freckleton,
was taken prisoner, and dragged, almost naked and barefooted,
through the miry and blood-stained streets to the spot where
Cuthbert, the eldest son of Thomas Clifton, of Lytham, was
standing after the carnage, in which he had led a party of the
besiegers. Captain Clifton and others near him were in a mood
for a somewhat rude and ungenerous entertainment, and placed the
hapless Sharples, in his dilapidated attire, in a prominent position
and, thrusting a Psalter into his hand, compelled him to sing a
Psalm for their delectation. After they had amused themselves
in such fashion for some time the prisoner was handed over to
the guard, from whom he ultimately made his escape. Captain
Cuthbert Clifton was elevated to the rank of colonel as an
acknowledgment of his gallant services at Bolton, after which he
returned for a few days into the Fylde, where he engaged himself
in procuring a fresh detachment of soldiers, who readily flocked to
his standard. For their provision and comfort he did not hesitate
or scruple to appropriate a number of cattle on Layton Hawes,
and to relieve some of the Puritans of Kirkham, Bispham, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
Poulton, of their bedding, etc. Having fully supplied his
commissariat department by these means, he marched to
Liverpool, and joining Prince Rupert, was present at the sacking
of that town.</p>

<p>The Civil War had proved most disastrous to Lancashire,
where the constant movements and frequent collisions of the
contending parties had ruined the towns, destroyed almost all
attempts at agriculture, and reduced the inhabitants to a state of
wretchedness and poverty, in many instances to the verge of
starvation; and notwithstanding the fact that in not one single
instance had the Fylde been the scene of an encounter, the people
of this section were in as lamentable a condition of penury and
suffering as those of the less fortunate districts, a circumstance
not to be wondered at when the incessant plunderings are taken
into consideration, and when it is remembered that the youth
and strength of the neighbourhood were serving as volunteers or
recruits, either under the banner of parliament or that of the king.
The 12th of September, 1644, was appointed by the Puritans as a
day of solemn prayer and fasting throughout the country, and
parliament decreed that half of the money collected “in all the
churches within the cities of London and Westminster and within
the lines of communication,” should be devoted to the relief of
the distressed and impoverished in this county.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Tyldesley accompanied the army of Prince Rupert
to York, near to where the sanguinary and famous battle of
Marston Moor, in which no less than sixty thousand men were
engaged on both sides, was fought on the 2nd of July, 1644.
Oliver Cromwell commanded the parliamentarians in person, and
after a fierce struggle discomfited the troops of Prince Rupert
and drove them in confusion from the field. Sir Thomas
Tyldesley retreated with his shattered regiment in hot haste
towards Amounderness, where he made diligent search for
arms and ammunition, but hearing that the enemy, under
Sir John Meldrum, was marching in quest of him he hurried
to the banks of the Ribble, and crossed the ford into the
Fylde. This latter incident happened towards the end of the
week, and on Saturday he was joined in his ambush by the
immense royalist force of Colonel Goring, so great indeed that
“before the last companies had marched over the bridge at St.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
Michael’s Church the first company was judged to be at Kirkham.”<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
There is probably some little exaggeration in the quoted statement,
but even allowing it to be verbally correct, there can be no
doubt that it is unintentionally misleading, as the extreme length of
road covered would be due more to the wide intervals between the
companies and the straggling manner in which they proceeded
than to their actual numerical strength. Nevertheless the detachment,
chiefly composed of cavalry, was enormous, and completely
inundated the towns and villages in the parishes of Poulton, Kirkham,
and Lytham. The men were lodged twenty, thirty, forty,
fifty, and even sixty in a house, and on the Sunday morning they
set out on an errand of pilfering without respect to persons, pillaging
those who were friendly with as much eagerness and apparent
satisfaction as others who were inimical to their cause, an impartiality
so little appreciated by the inhabitants that they are said to
have blessed the Roundheads by comparison with these insatiate
freebooters. Horses, money, clothes, sheets, everything that was
portable or could be driven, was greedily seized upon, and, in spite
of threats and entreaties, remorselessly borne away. Hundreds of
households were stripped not only of their ornaments, bedding,
etc., but even of the very implements on which the family depended
for subsistence. It is in truth no figure of speech to state that by
far the larger share of the people were reduced to utter and seemingly
hopeless destitution, and grateful indeed were they when
their portion of the parliamentary grant of collections in the
metropolis, before mentioned, was distributed amongst them,
coming like manna from the heavens to comfort their desolated
homes. To add insult to injury the graceless troopers compelled
their entertainers to employ the Sabbath in winnowing corn in
the fields for their chargers, and even refused to allow them to
erect the usual curtains to protect the grain from being carried
away by the high wind, so that the loss and waste amounted to
barely less than the quantity utilised as fodder, and completely
exhausted the fruits of their harvest. Sir Thomas Tyldesley, Lord
Molyneux, and others of the leaders, fixed their lodgment near
the residence of a gentleman named Richard Harrison, and
were supplied with necessaries from Mowbreck Hall. Freckleton<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
marsh was the rendezvous, and there the entire forces assembled
on the morning of Monday, but were compelled to remain until
one o’clock at noon before the Ribble was fordable, when they took
their departure, to the intense joy of all those who had trembled
for their lives and suffered ruin in their small properties during
their brief sojourn. Sir John Meldrum appeared in the district
only a few hours after the royalists had left, and thus the Fylde
had again a narrow escape of adding one more to the long list of
unnatural battles, most truly described as suicidal massacres of the
nation, where men ignoring the ties of friendship or kinship imbrued
their swords in the blood of each other with a relentless and
inhuman savagery, reviving as it seemed the horrid butcheries of
the dark ages. Sir John Meldrum hastened in the direction of
the retreating foe, but failed to overtake them.</p>

<p>“In 1645,” writes Rushworth, “there remained of unreduced
garrisons belonging to the king in Lancashire only Lathom House
and Greenhalgh Castle.”<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> This castle was erected about half a
mile eastward of Garstang, overlooking the Wyre, by Thomas, the
first earl of Derby, in 1490, after the victory of Bosworth Field, as
a protection from certain of the outlawed nobles, whose estates in
that vicinity had rewarded the services of the earl to Henry VII.
The castle was built in a rectangular form almost approaching to
a square, with a tower at each angle. The edifice was surrounded
and protected by a wide moat. The garrison occupying the small
fortress at the date under consideration held out until the death of
the governor, when a capitulation was made, and, about 1649, the
castle was dismantled. In 1772 Penant spoke of the “poor
remains of Greenhalgh Castle.”<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>The fall of Lathom House and other strongholds of the king and
the surrender of Charles himself to the Scotch army of Puritans,
brought the contests for a time to a close in 1647, and Sir Thomas
Tyldesley, with several more, received instructions to disband the
troops under his command. During the foregoing struggles
parliament, in order to provide the necessary funds for the increased
expenditure, had allowed “delinquents, papists, spies, and
intelligencers” to compound for their sequestered estates, and
amongst those connected with this locality who had taken<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>

<p>Presbyterianism became the national, or at least, the state
religion, and for the regulation of ecclesiastical matters the
Assembly of Divines, at Westminster, suggested that the country
should be divided into provinces, whose representatives should
hold annual conferences at the larger towns. The county of
Lancaster was divided into nine Classical Presbyteries, and the
seventh Classis, embracing the parishes of Preston, Kirkham,
Garstang, and Poulton, consisted of—</p>

<p>One of the duties of these Classes was to examine, ordain, and
appoint ministers, or presbyters, as they were called, whenever
vacancies occurred in the district over which, respectively, they
had jurisdiction; subjoined is the certificate given in the case of
Cuthbert Harrison, B.A., when selected and appointed presbyter
of Singleton chapel:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Whereas Cuthbert Harrison, B.A., aged 30 years, hath addressed himself to
us, authorised by ordinance of parliament of 22 Aug. 1646, for ordination of
ministers, desiring to be ordained a presbyter, being chosen by the inhabitants
within the chapelry of Singleton to officiate there; and having been examined by
us the ministers of the Seventh Classis, and found sufficiently qualified
for the ministerial functions, according to the rules preserved in the said ordinance,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
and thereupon approved—we have this day solemnly set him apart to the office of
presbyter and work of the ministry of the gospel, by laying on of hands by us
present, with fasting and prayer, by virtue whereof we declare him to be a lawful
and sufficiently authorised minister of Jesus Christ. In testimony whereof we
have hereunto put our hands the 27th Nov., 1651.”</p>

</div>

<p>In 1648 General Langdale, a royalist officer, appealed to the
loyalty of the northern counties to attempt a rescue of the imprisoned
monarch from the hands of his enemies. Many rushed
to his standard, and the parliamentarians of the Fylde shared the
general consternation which pervaded Lancashire at the success of
his effort to rekindle the still smouldering embers of civil war.
There is no necessity to trace the steps of this ill-judged enterprise
to its disastrous issue, but suffice it to say that the defeat and
routing of the little army was followed at a very short interval by
the execution of Charles I., after a formal trial in which he disclaimed
the jurisdiction of the court.</p>

<p>On the 22nd of June, 1650, a meeting of Commissioners under
the Great Seal of England was held at Preston—“for inquiring
into and certeifying of the certeine numbers and true yearely
value of all parsonages and vicariges presentative, of all and every
the sp’uall and eccli’call benefices, livings, and donatives within
the said countye”; and after examining the good and lawful men
of Kirkham and Lytham, it was recommended by the assembly
that Goosnargh and Whittingham should be formed into a
separate parish on account of their great distance from the church
at Kirkham. At this inquiry it was also stated that—“the
inhabitants of Newsham desired to be annexed to Woodplumpton;
the inhabitants of Clifton and Salwick, together with the
inhabitants of Newton-cum-Scales, and the upper end of Treales,
desired to be united in one parish. Singleton chappell, newly
erected, desired that it might be made a parish. The inhabitants
of Weeton-cum-Preese desired that that township might be made
a parish, and the inhabitants of Rawcliffe desired to be annexed to
it. The townships of Rigby-cum-Wraye, and of Warton, and of
Kellamore-cum-Bryning, and Westbye-cum-Plumpton, all humbly
desired to be made a parish. The several townships of Eccleston
Parva-cum-Labrecke, and the inhabitants of Medlar and Thistleton,
and the inhabitants of Rossaker-cum-Wharles, desired to be
annexed to Elswick, and that it might be made a parish.” Although<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
at that time these petitions failed in obtaining their
objects, much the same thing has been accomplished in more
recent years by Lord Blandford’s Act, by which separate parochial
districts, as far as ecclesiastical matters are concerned, have been
appropriated to each church, thus rendering it independent of the
mother-church of the ancient parish in which it might happen to
be situated.</p>

<p>In 1651 the son of the unfortunate monarch, who had been
proclaimed king by the Scotch under the title of Charles II.,
crossed the frontier and invaded England with a force of fourteen
thousand men. That year the earl of Derby, Sir Thomas
Tyldesley, and several other officers, sailed from the Isle of Man,
whither they had retired, in obedience to the call of the young
prince, and landed either on the Warren, at the mouth of the
river Wyre, or at Skippool higher up the stream, with a regiment
of two hundred and fifty infantry and sixty cavalry. Two of the
vessels grounded during the operation of disembarking the horses,
and in the heavy winds that ensued were reduced to total wrecks.
As soon as the news of the earl of Derby’s arrival on the banks of
the Wyre was rumoured abroad, “all the ships,” says the <i>Perfect
Diurnall</i>, “were wafted out of the rivers of Liverpool, and set
sail with a fair wind fore Wirewater, where the Frigots rid that
brought the Lord Derby over with his company, to surprise them
and prevent his Lordship escaping any way by water.” The earl
marched through the Fylde, but the martial ardour of the
inhabitants was not so readily excited as on former occasions, for
the recollection of their abusive and piratical treatment by the
troopers of Colonel Goring, in 1644, was still fresh in their minds,
and effectually checked any feelings of enthusiasm at seeing the
royal banners once again unfurled in their midst. A scattered
few, however, there were who were willing to forget the misdeeds
of the agents in their eagerness for the success of the cause, and
with such meagre additions to his strength the earl hastened on.
At Preston he raised six hundred horse, and shortly afterwards
encountered the parliamentarians, under Colonel Lilburne, at
Wigan-lane, where the royalists were defeated with great
slaughter. Sir Thomas Tyldesley was slain, and the gallant earl
escaped from the field only to be taken prisoner in Cheshire and
suffer the fate of his late regal master, Charles I. Alexander<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
Rigby, the grandson of the Alexander Rigby, of Layton, before
mentioned, and only seventeen years of age, also took part in this
eventful engagement, and twenty-eight years subsequently, when
High Sheriff of the county of Lancaster, erected a monument to
the memory of Major-General Sir Thomas Tyldesley near the
spot where he fell. So universally esteemed was the valiant
knight for his bravery and honourable conduct that the title of
“Chevalier sans peur et sans reproche” was conferred upon him
alike by friends and enemies. Charles II., after the overthrow of
his army by Cromwell, adopted the disguise of a peasant, and
having narrowly escaped detection by hiding himself amidst the
foliage of an oak tree, fled at the first opportunity over to France.
Cromwell was now installed in the chief seat of authority and held
the reins of government under the style of Lord Protector.</p>

<p>In 1660, two years after the death of Cromwell, Charles II.
was recalled and placed upon the throne; and in 1662
a law was passed by which it was enacted that before St.
Bartholomew’s Day of that year, all ministers should arrange
their services according to the rules contained in the new book of
Common Prayer, under pain of dismissal from their preferments.
The following letter was received by the churchwardens of
Garstang, ordering the ejectment of the Rev. Isaac Ambrose, who
was a member of the family of Ambrose of Ambrose Hall, in
Wood Plumpton, from his benefice on account of his refusal to
conform to the arbitrary regulation:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Whereas in a late act of Parliament for uniformitie, it is enacted that every
parson, vicar, curate, lecturer, or other ecclesiasticall person, neglecting or refusing,
before the Feast Day of St. Bartholomew, 1662, to declare openly before their
respective congregations, his assent and consent to all things contained in the
book of common prayer established by the said act, <i>ipso facto</i>, be deposed, and that
every person not being in holy orders by episcopall ordination, and every parson,
vicar, curate, lecturer, or other ecclesiasticall person, failing in his subscription to
a declaration mentioned in the said act to be subscribed before the Feast Day of
St. Bartholomew, 1662, shall be utterly disabled, and <i>ipso facto</i> deprived, and his
place be void, as if the person so failing be naturally dead. And whereas Isaac
Ambrose, late Vicar of Garstang, in the county of Lancaster, hath neglected to
declare and subscribe according to the tenor of the said act, I doe therefore declare
the church of Garstang to be now void, and doe strictly charge the said Isaac
Ambrose, late vicar of the said church, to forbear preaching, lecturing, or officiating
in the said church, or elsewhere in the diocese of Chester. And the churchwardens
of the said parish of Garstang are hereby required (as by duty they are
bound) to secure and preserve the said parish church of Garstang from any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
invasion or intrusion of the said Isaac Ambrose, disabled and deprived as above
said by the said act, and the churchwardens are also required upon sight hereof to
show this order to the said Isaac Ambrose, and cause the same to be published
next Sunday after in the Parish Church of Garstang, before the congregation, as
they will answer the contrary.—Given under my hand this 29th day of August,
1662.</p>

<p class="center">“Geo. Cestriens.</p>

<p class="center">“To the Churchwardens of Garstang, in the County Palatine of Lancaster.”</p>

</div>

<p>In this county sixty-seven ministers refused to submit to the
mandate, and were removed from their churches by the authority
of documents similar to the above, and prohibited from officiating
in their priestly capacity anywhere within the diocese. Amongst
the number, so interdicted, were the Rev. W. Bullock, of
Hambleton, the Rev. Joseph Harrison, of Lund chapel, and the
Rev. Nathaniel Baxter, M.A., of St. Michael’s-on-Wyre. The
Nonconformists were subsequently subjected to even greater
harshness and injustice by an act which decreed that no
clergyman, belonging to any of their sects, should reside within
five miles of the town or place at which he had last preached,
unless he took an oath as under:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I do swear that it is not lawful, upon any pretence whatsoever, to take arms
against the king, and that I do abhor the traitorous position of taking arms
against his authority; against his person; or against those that are commissioned
by him, in pursuance of such commissions; and that I will not at any time
endeavour any alteration of government either in church or state.”</p>

</div>

<p>The sufferings experienced by those ministers who had been
deprived of their benefices are described as having been extreme,
nay, almost intolerable, and it was doubtless owing to the great
severity practised towards the body of Nonconformists that the
old creed gained such little popularity for some time after its
re-establishment.</p>

<p>Charles II., soon after the restoration of monarchy at his
coronation, determined to create a new order of knighthood, to
be called the “Royal Oak,” as a reward to some of the more
distinguished of his faithful adherents, and amongst the number
selected for the honour were Col. Kirkby, of Upper Rawcliffe,
Richard Butler, of Out Rawcliffe, and Edward Tyldesley, of Fox
Hall, Blackpool.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> The design was shortly abandoned by the advice<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
of the crown ministers, who foresaw that the necessarily limited
distribution of the distinction would give rise to jealousy and
animosity amongst those who had been active in the late wars.</p>

<p>In 30 Charles II. a statute was passed entitled “An act for
lessening the importation of linen from beyond the seas, and the
encouragement of the woollen and paper manufactories of the
kingdom”; and by it was provided, under a penalty of £5, half of
which was to be distributed to the poor of the parish, that at
every interment throughout the country a certificate should be
presented to the officiating minister stating that the winding
sheet of the deceased person was composed of woollen material and
not of linen, as heretofore. The certificate ordered to be used
at every burial ran thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>A</i>, of the parish of <i>B</i>, in the county of <i>C</i>, maketh Oath that <i>D</i>, of the parish
of <i>B</i>, in the county of <i>C</i>, lately deceased, was not put in, wrapt or wound up or
Buried, in any Shirt, Shift, Sheet, or Shroud, made or mingled with Flax, Hemp,
Silk, Hair, Gold, or Silver, or other than that which is made of Sheep’s Wool
only. Nor in any Coffin lined or faced with any cloth, stuff, or anything whatsoever,
made or mingled with Flax, Hemp, Silk, Hair, Gold, or Silver, or any other
material but Sheep’s Wool only.</p>

<p>“Dated the ... day of ... in the xxxth year of the reign of our
Sovereign Lord, Charles the second, king of England, Scotland, France, and
Ireland, etc.</p>

<p>“Sealed and Subscribed by us, who were present and witnesses to the Swearing
of the above said affidavit</p>

<p class="right">(Signatures of two witnesses.)</p>

<p>“I, ..., esq., one of the King’s Majesties Justices of the Peace for the
County above said, do hereby certify that the day and year above said <i>A</i> came before
me and made such affidavit as is above specified according to the late Act of
Parliament, entitled An Act for burying in Woollen.</p>

<p class="right">(Signature.)”</p>

</div>

<p>The foregoing statute was amended two years later, and the
modified enactment continued in force for some time, when it was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
repealed. In the registers of old churches, such as Bispham,
Poulton, Kirkham, and St. Michael’s-on-Wyre, where they have
been preserved, notices of burials according to this regulation
during the two years it was in operation, may be seen; and
amongst the records of the Thirty-men, or governing body of
Kirkham, is an entry of expenses incurred when they went “to
justice Stanley” to obtain his authority to “demand 50s. for
Tomlinson’s wife buried in linen,” contrary to the law.</p>

<p>Three years from the accession of James II., his repeated
attempts to curtail the civil and religious liberties of his subjects
had so far incensed them against him that William, Prince of
Orange, was invited over to free them from his rule. In 1688
James abdicated the throne, and the following year William and
Mary were crowned at Westminster. Annexed is a list of the
gentry residing in the Fylde from the reign of Henry VIII., to

<p>James II., when force of circumstances had driven him into
exile, left a considerable number of supporters behind him, chiefly
amongst the Roman Catholics, who were not dilatory in devising
schemes for his re-establishment. On the 16th of May, 1690,
Robert Dodsworth deposed upon oath, before Lord Chief Justice
Holt, that the following Popish gentry of the Fylde, amongst
others, had entered into a conspiracy to restore James, and that
they had received commissions as indicated for the purpose of
raising troops to carry out the enterprise:—Colonel Thomas<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
Tyldesley, son of the late Sir Thomas; Captains Ralph Tyldesley,
son of the late Sir Thomas; Thomas Tyldesley, of Fox Hall,
nephew to the two preceding; Richard Butler, of Rawcliffe Hall,
and Henry, his eldest son; Thomas Westby, of Mowbreck Hall,
and William, his third son, who was designated a lieutenant; and
Lieutenant Richard Stanley, of Great Eccleston Hall. Nothing
is recorded as to the result of the above information, but in 1694
Sir Thomas Clifton, brother to Cuthbert Clifton, of Lytham, was
arraigned, with several more, on a charge of treason in connection
with a reported Jacobite plot, but was acquitted, as also were those
with him. During the course of the trial, Thomas Patten, of
Preston, as witness to the loyalty of Sir Thomas Clifton to the
existing government, stated that “in 1689 he received orders from
the Lord Lieutenant to secure several Popish gentlemen, and that
amongst them Sir Thomas Clifton was one who was taken and
brought prisoner to Preston upon the 16th day of June in that
year; that Sir Thomas being a very infirm man and unfit to be
carried so far as Manchester, which was the place where the rest
of the Popish gentlemen then made prisoners were secured, he
undertook for Sir Thomas, and prevailed to have him kept at his
(Patten’s) own house in Preston, where he continued prisoner, and
was not discharged until the January following, at which time all
the gentlemen were set at liberty; that during Sir Thomas
Clifton’s confinement he expressed to him much zeal and affection
to the present government, saying how much the persons of his
religion ought to be satisfied with their usage, as putting no difference
betwixt them and other subjects save the public exercise of
their religion, so long as they themselves would be quiet, and
protested for himself that he could never endure to think of
practising any change.” Further Mr. Patten affirmed “that he
knew Sir Thomas’s disposition to have always been peaceful and
quiet.” During the time that James II. was engaged in inciting
the Irish nation to espouse his cause and furnish him with an
army to invade England and regain his throne, Thomas Tyldesley,
of Fox Hall, prepared a secret chamber in that mansion for his
reception. The disastrous battle of the Boyne, however, in which
James was vanquished by William, Prince of Orange, and King
of England, crushed all hope of future success in the fallen
monarch, and at the earliest opportunity he escaped to France.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
In 1715, during the reign of George I., his son, the Chevalier de
St. George was proclaimed king in Scotland under the title of
James III. The earl of Mar and several other influential supporters
of the Stuarts assembled a large force and marched southwards;
on arriving at the border five hundred of the Highlanders
refused to proceed further, but the remainder passed through the
northern counties as far as Preston. Here they were besieged by
the loyal troops under Generals Carpenter and Wills, who
stormed the town and forced the rebels to an unconditional
surrender. Many of the leaders were executed, whilst others
were incarcerated for various terms; the general treatment of
their unfortunate followers may be gleaned from the journal of
William Stout, of Lancaster, in which it is written:—“After the
rebellion was suppressed about 400 of the rebels were brought to
Lancaster Castle, and a regiment of Dragoons was quartered in
the town to guard them. The king allowed them each 4d. a day
for maintenance, viz., 2d. in bread, 1d. in cheese, and 1d. in small
beer. And they laid on straw in stables most of them, and in a
month’s time about 100 of them were conveyed to Liverpool to be
tried, where they were convicted and near 40 of them hanged at
Preston, Garstang, Lancaster, etc.; and about 200 of them continued
a year, and about 50 of them died, and the rest were
transported to America.” Thomas Tyldesley, of Fox Hall, died in
1715, just before the outbreak of the rebellion, but his son Edward,
who succeeded him, joined the rebels. For this act of treason he
was put on his trial, but escaped conviction and punishment
through the favour of the jury, by whom he was acquitted
in spite of clear and reliable evidence that he had entered
Preston at the head of a company of insurgents with a
drawn sword in his hand. After the capitulation, when
the king’s troops had entered the town and were marching
along the streets, many men from our district, who had
congregated on Spiral’s Moss, armed with fowling pieces and
implements of husbandry, joined their ranks, and a huge duck-gun
belonging to a yeoman named Jolly, from Mythorp, near Blackpool,
was instrumental in doing good service to the besiegers by
slaying one Mayfield, of the Ashes, Goosnargh. The rebel had
secreted himself behind a chimney on one of the houses, and was
engaged in picking off the loyal soldiers as they made their way<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
along the thoroughfare below. His murderous fire was at length
put an end to by a charge from the famed gun of Jolly, whose
keen eye had detected the assassin in his hiding place. Jolly
himself appears to have had an aversion to causing the death of a
fellow-creature in cold blood, even though a rebel, and the credit
of the shot is due to a soldier, whose own weapon failed in reaching
the object. The Rev. W. Thornber tells us in his History of
Blackpool, that the family of the Jollys, for many years, treasured
up the wonderful gun, and that the tale of its exploit was circulated
far and wide in the neighbourhood of their home. From
the remarks of the Rev.—Patten, who accompanied the army of
the Chevalier, as chaplain to General Forster, we learn that those
who joined the insurgents in Lancashire were chiefly Papists,
and that the members of the High-church party held aloof, much
to the disappointment and chagrin of General Forster, who, in his
anger, declared “that for the time to come he would never again
believe a drunken tory.” Edward Tyldesley, Henry Butler, of
Rawcliffe Hall, and his son Richard Butler, were the most distinguished
personages amongst the small body of men belonging to
this section who openly espoused the cause of the Pretender. The
paucity of the recruits attracted by the insurgent standard from our
neighbourhood is easily to be accounted for, when it is remembered
that for many years the county of Lancashire had enjoyed an
immunity from strifes and disturbances, so that the inhabitants of
the rural districts, such as the Fylde, had settled down to the
cultivation of the soil, and would care little to assist in a work
which as far as they were privately concerned, could only terminate
in the devastation of their fields, and, probably, in the ruin of
many of their households. Especially, in 1715, would the people
be disinclined to take part in or encourage insurrectionary and warlike
proceedings, for in that year extraordinarily bountiful
harvests had rewarded their labours, and general prosperity had
taught them the blessings of peace.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> After the rebellion of 1715

<p>Prince Charles Edward, the son of the former Pretender,
landed in the Hebrides, in 1745, with a well-officered force of two
thousand men, and after defeating Sir John Cope, seized the city
of Edinburgh and commenced his march southwards. Crossing
the border, he passed through Lancashire, and arrived at Preston
with an army barely six thousand strong. At Preston he met
with an enthusiastic welcome, the church bells were rung, and
loud cheers greeted the proclamation of his father, the Chevalier,
as king of Great Britain and Ireland. His sojourn in the town
was brief, and on the 27th of November the rebel troops set out
for Manchester, inspirited by the lively strains of “The King
shall have his own again.” Arriving at that city, they continued<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
their march towards Derby, where, on receiving the news that the
Duke of Cumberland was at Lichfield on his way to intercept
them, Prince Charles Edward hastened to beat a retreat, and on
the 12th of December re-passed through the streets of Preston,
the wearied feet of his followers keeping time to the doleful but
appropriate air of “Hie the Charlie home again.”</p>

<p>The battle on the moor of Culloden, in which the rebel army
was defeated by the Duke of Cumberland, finally decided the fate
of the House of Stuart, and after experiencing many hardships,
Prince Charles Edward escaped across the channel into France.
James, the son of Edward Tyldesley who took part in the
insurrection of 1715, served in the army of the Young Pretender.
During the excitement and alarm produced by these rebellions,
silver spoons, tankards, and other household treasures, were
deposited for safety in a farm house at Marton; cattle and other
farm-stock were driven to Boonley, near Blackpool, whilst money
and articles of jewelry were buried in the soil of Hound Hill in
that town. The Scots who accompanied Prince Charles were so
renowned for their voracious appetites that the householders of
the Fylde prepared for their expected visit by laying in an
abundant supply of eatables, hoping that a good repast, like a soft
answer, would turn away wrath. Mr. Physic, of Poulton, was an
exception to the general rule, and having barricaded his house,
determined vigorously to resist any attack of the rebels either
on his larder or his purse. Hotly pursued by the Duke of
Cumberland in their retreat towards Scotland, the insurgents
were quickly hurried through the country, but some of the
stragglers found their way to Mains Hall, where they were
liberally provided with food by Mrs. Hesketh. It is probable that
these rebels formed part of the number of Highlanders, who were
afterwards captured at Garstang, and that one of them was the
bare-footed Scot who seized the boots of John Miller, of Layton,
dragging them from his feet with the cool remark—“Hout mon,
but I mon tak’ thy brogues.” William Hesketh, of Mains, had
considered it prudent to secrete himself on the warren at Rossall
until the excitement had subsided, as in some way or other he
had been mixed up with the former outbreak, and wished to
avoid any suspicion of having been implicated in this one also.
At the sanguinary and decisive battle of Culloden, two notorious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
characters from Layton and Staining were present; one of them,
named Leonard Warbreck, served in the capacity of hangman at
the executions following the rebellion, whilst the other, James
Kirkham, generally known as Black Kirkham, was a gallant
soldier, remarkable for his giant-like size and immense strength.
The country people near his home were wont to declare that,
for a small wager, this warrior carried his horse and accoutrements
round the cross at Wigan to the astonishment and admiration of
the by-standers. One incident of these times, reflecting little
credit on this neighbourhood, but which, as faithful recorders,
we are bound to relate, was the journey of Henry Hardicar, of
Little Poulton, to London, a distance of two hundred and thirty-three
miles, all of which he travelled on foot, solely to gratify a
morbid taste by witnessing the legal tragedies performed on
Tower Hill. “I saw the lords heided” was his invariable
answer to all inquiries as to the wonders he had seen in the
metropolis. In this rising, as in the earlier one, the inhabitants
of the Fylde evinced their prudence and good sense by remaining
as nearly neutral as their allegiance to the reigning monarch
would permit them. Those insurgents who found their way into
the district were treated with kindness, but no encouragement
was given them to prolong their stay, either by professions of
sympathy or offers of assistance in their insurrectionary enterprise.</p>

<p>We have at last come to the end of the long chain of wars and
disturbances which from the period of the struggles between the
Houses of York and Lancaster, had exercised their baneful
influence on the territory and population of the Fylde, and are
now entering on an era of peace and unbroken prosperity. The
small water-side hamlets of Blackpool and Lytham put forth
their rival claims to the patronage of the inland residents,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“And had their claims allow’d.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In 1788, Mr. Hutton described the former place as consisting of
about fifty houses and containing four hundred visitors in the
height of the season. This historian also informs us, that the
inhabitants were remarkable for their great longevity, and relates
the anecdote of a woman who, forming one of a group of
sympathising friends around the couch of a dying man, exclaimed—“Poor
John! I knew him a clever young fellow four score
years ago.” Lytham, also, attracted a considerable number of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
visitors during the summer, and for many years was a more
popular resort than Blackpool. In Mr. Baines’s account of
Lytham, published in 1825, we read as follows:—“This is one of
the most popular sea-bathing places in the county of Lancashire;
and if the company is less fashionable than at Blackpool, it is
generally more numerous, and usually very respectable.”</p>

Lancaster, was collected in 1819, and subjoined are enumerated

<p>In 1836 the first house of Fleetwood was erected, and in a few
years the desolate warren at the mouth of the Wyre was converted
into a rising and prosperous town. The rapidity of its early
growth may be inferred from the following paragraph, extracted
from a volume on Lancashire, published during the infancy of this
new offspring of the Fylde:—“As a bathing place, it possesses
very superior attractions: hot water baths, inns, and habitations
of all kinds have sprung as if by magic on one of the most
agreeable sites it is possible to imagine, very superior to any other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
in Lancashire, admitting, as from a central point, excursions by
land and water in all directions, amongst some of the most
beautiful scenery in the empire. A couple of hours steaming takes
the tourist across Morecambe Bay to the Furness capital, and into
the heart of a district of surpassing interest. Charming indeed
is Fleetwood in the height of the summer, with its cool sands,
northern aspect, and delightful prospects. First there is a noble
bay in front, an ocean of itself when the tide is in; and when it
is out offering firm sands of vast extent, for riding or walking.”
Sir Peter Hesketh Fleetwood, bart., of Rossall Hall, lord of the
manor, and founder of the town to which he gave his name, was
returned on four occasions as one of the parliamentary representatives
of Preston:—</p>

<p class="center90">MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT FOR PRESTON.</p>

<li>1841.—Sir Peter Hesketh Fleetwood, Bart., and Sir Geo. Strickland, Bart.</li>
</ul>

<p>The year 1840 was an auspicious one in the history of the Fylde.
On the 25th of July, the Preston and Wyre Railway, running
through the heart of this district, was completed and declared
open for traffic. By its means the farmer became enabled to
convey his produce to the extensive market of Preston; and
Kirkham, Poulton, and Garstang were no longer the only towns
accessible to our agriculturists for the sale of their crops. The
early appreciation of the utility and benefit of the line is apparent
from the rapid increase of its traffic, as shown by the annexed
tables, in which the official returns of passengers and goods for
the week ending Dec. 14th, 1842, and the corresponding weeks
of the four succeeding years are stated:—</p>

<p>At the present date, 1876, the average weekly traffic on this
railway and its branches to Lytham and Blackpool, amounts
in round numbers to £1,200 for passengers, and £800 for goods.</p>

<p>The Preston and Wyre Railway was amongst the earliest formed,
and the impression made on the natives of this district, who had
been accustomed to the slow-going coaches, must have been one
of no little amazement, when, for the first time, they beheld the
“iron horse” steaming along the rails at a speed which their past
experience of travelling would make them regard as impossible.
The following lines were written by a gentleman named Henry
Anderton, a resident in the Fylde, on the opening of the railway:</p>

<p>Until the opening of the branch lines to Lytham and Blackpool
respectively, in 1846, passengers completed their journies from
Kirkham and Poulton to those watering places by means of
coaches. Three trains ran from the terminus at Fleetwood to
Preston on each week-day, and one on Sunday, a similar number
returning.</p>

<p>In consequence of the severe distress prevailing throughout the
country, a proclamation was issued by Her Majesty for a General
Fast to be held on Wednesday, the 24th of March, 1847; and
from the public prints of that date it is evident that the occasion
was observed with great solemnity in our division—the shops of
the different towns were closed during the whole of the day, the
streets were quiet, the hotels deserted, whilst the churches were
crowded even to overflowing. This distress was caused by an
almost complete failure in the potatoe harvests; and at that time
these necessary articles of diet were sold at 26s. per load in the
local markets, whilst meal, also scarce, rose to 52s. per load.</p>

<p>In September of the same year, the Fylde was honoured by a
passing visit from Queen Victoria and the late Prince Consort,
who arrived at Fleetwood in the Royal Yacht on their return
journey from Scotland to London. An address was presented
by Sir P. H. Fleetwood, bart., the Rev. St. Vincent Beechey,
Frederick Kemp, esq., James Crombleholme, esq., and Daniel
Elletson, esq., on behalf of the inhabitants of Fleetwood, and
received by Lord Palmerston, who promised that it should be
laid before the Queen. In the course of a few days an
acknowledgment was received from the metropolis. In Her
Majesty’s book, published in 1868, and entitled “Leaves from
our Highland Journal,” these diarian entries relating to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
above event appear:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“Monday, September 20th, 1847.</p>

<p>“We anchored at seven in Fleetwood Harbour; the entrance was extremely
narrow and difficult. We were lashed close to the pier, to prevent our being
turned by the tide; and when I went on deck there was a great commotion, such
running and calling, and pulling of ropes, etc. It was a cheerless evening,
blowing hard.”</p>

<p class="right">“Tuesday, September 21st, 1847.</p>

<p>“At ten o’clock we landed, and proceeded by rail to London.”</p>

</div>

<p>In 1860, a project was launched for a comprehensive scheme of
water supply for the towns of this district; a company was
established, and, in the session of 1861, an act of parliament was
obtained “for incorporating the Fylde Waterworks Company, and
for authorising them to make and maintain waterworks, and
to supply water at Kirkham, Lytham, Blackpool, Fleetwood,
Poulton, Rossall, Garstang, South-shore, and Bispham, in the
county palatine of Lancaster, and to shipping at Fleetwood and
Lytham.” The act granted power to take the water from Grizedale
Brook, a tributary of the Wyre, which rises in Grizedale Fell,
one of the Bleasdale range, and, flowing through the gorge or
pass, called Nickey Nook, divides the township of Nether-Wyersdale
and Barnacre-with-Bonds, and falls into the Wyre a
mile or so before that river reaches Garstang. A dam or embankment,
upwards of 20 feet high, 70 feet wide at the base, and 12
feet wide at the top, was raised across the valley, converting the
upper portion of it into a reservoir. At the west end of the
reservoir, below the embankment, is a culvert, through which
the water passes to a guage, where a stipulated quantity is turned
into the brook, and the rest enters the pipe for the Fylde.
Twelve miles of twelve inch pipes carry the water to the service
reservoir at Weeton. The course is down Grizedale, under the
railway, through Greenhalgh Green, Bowgrave, leaving Garstang
to the right, then past Catterall Mill, through the grounds
of Catterall Hall, and onward to the east of St. Michael’s,
through Elswick, to Weeton. The service reservoir, situated on
the most elevated ground, called Whitprick Hill, in the township
of Weeton, has a diameter at the base of 400 feet, and at the top
468 feet. The embankment is at the base 70 feet in diameter, and
12 feet at the top, with a puddle trench in it, varying from 8 feet
8 inches to 6 feet wide. To the south a 10 inch main takes the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
supply of water for Kirkham and Lytham; and from the west
side a main of similar size takes the water for Fleetwood and
Blackpool, the supply for the former place branching off near
Great Marton, and going by Bispham and Rossall. The Weeton
reservoir was formed capable of containing fifteen million gallons
of water. An additional pipe, running from Weeton through
Singleton, Skippool, and Thornton, to join the Fleetwood main
at Flakefleet, near Rossall, was laid in 1875; and a new reservoir,
to hold 190,000,000 gallons, is in course of formation at Barnacre,
above Grizedale.</p>

<p class="dropcap">There is little to be remarked, because little is
known, respecting the social and moral aspects of
the untutored race which, in the earliest historic age,
sought a domicile or refuge amidst the forests of
the Fylde, or invaded its glades in search of prey. The habits
of the Setantii were simply those of other savage tribes who
depended for their daily sustenance upon their skill and prowess
in the chase, and whose intercommunion with the world beyond
their own limited domains, was confined to hostile or friendly
meetings with equally barbarous races whose frontiers adjoined
their own. Certain disinterred roots were necessary adjuncts
to their repasts, and indeed, on many occasions, when outwitted
by the wild tenants of the woods, formed the sole item. Their
Druidical faith and the supreme power of the priesthood over
their almost every action, both secular and religious, have already
been referred to in an earlier page. The remorseless sacrifice of
fellow beings on their unhallowed altars, and the general spirit
of cruelty and inhumanity which pervaded all their rites, are not
to be regarded as disclosing a naturally callous and brutal
disposition on the part of the Setantii, but as indications of the
deplorable ignorance in which they existed, and the blind
obedience which they yielded to the principles indoctrinated
by the Druids. That the Setantii, however submissive to the
dictates and requirements of their priests, were far from passively
allowing the encroachments of others on their liberties is shown
by the promptitude and fierceness with which they combatted
the progress of the Roman legions through their territory. No<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
portion of the British conquest cost the conquerors more trouble,
time, and bloodshed, than did the land peopled by the hardy and
valorous Brigantes with their comparatively small, but equally
intrepid, neighbours and allies the Setantii. The two most
striking characteristics of the aboriginal Fylde inhabitants were
their ignorance and bravery, and whilst the former rivetted the
chains which held them in subjection to the priesthood, the latter
incited them to oppose to the death the usurpations of the
stranger. There is nothing of local interest to recount during
the period the Romans held the soil, but after their abdication,
when the Anglo-Saxons violated their faith and traitorously
seized a land which they had come professedly to protect, the
Fylde began to evince symptoms of greater animation; villages
sprang up in different spots on the open grounds or clearings in
the woods; the solitary Roman settlement at Kirkham was
appropriated and renamed by the new arrivals, and, perhaps,
for the first time a population of numerical importance was
established in the district.</p>

<p>During the earlier part of this era the inhabitants were graziers
rather than agriculturists or ploughmen. Three quarters, even,
of the entire kingdom were devoted to rearing and feeding cattle,
so that the grain produce of the country must have been
extremely small when compared with the superabundance of
live stock, and as a consequence of such a condition of things,
those animals which could forage for themselves and exist upon
the wild herbage of the waste lands or the fallen fruits of the
trees, as acorns and beech-mast, were to be purchased at prices
almost nominal, whilst others which required the cultivated
products of the fields, as corn and hay, for their sustenance, were
disproportionately dear; thus about the end of the tenth century
the values of the former were:—</p>

<p>Trees were valued not by the circumference or magnitude of
their trunks, but by the amount of shelter their branches would
afford to the cattle, which seem to have lived almost entirely in
the open pastures; and bearing that in mind we are not surprised
to read in the Saxon Chronicle of periodical plagues or murrains
breaking out amongst them. “In 1054,” says that journal,
“there was so great loss of cattle as was not remembered for
many winters before.” This, however, is only one extract from
frequent entries referring to similar misfortunes in different years,
both before and after the date quoted. Swine were kept in
immense herds throughout the kingdom, and there is every
probability that in a locality like the Fylde, where trees
would still abound and provender be plentifully scattered
from the oaks and beeches, hogs would be extensively bred.
Indeed immediately after the close of the Saxon empire, Roger de
Poictou conveyed his newly acquired right to pawnage (swine’s
food) in the woods of Poulton, amongst other things, to the
monastery of St. Mary, in Lancaster, a circumstance strongly
favourable to the existence of swine there in considerable
numbers. Kine, also, are usually reported to have been a
favourite stock with the breeders of Lancashire, whilst sheep
were rare in proportion, although in other places they were
exceedingly popular and profitable, chiefly from the sale of their
wool.</p>

<p>The Saxon inhabitants of the small villages in the Fylde who
were engaged in agriculture had no knowledge of any manure
beyond marl, which they mixed with lighter and finer soils; nor
were their farm-lands cultivated all at one time, but a portion
only of the estate was subjected to the action of the plough, and
when its fertility had been thoroughly exhausted, the remainder
was tilled and brought into service, the first plot being allowed
to lie fallow for a few years until its productive powers had been
renewed. Grain was not, as now, purchased from the growers by
dealers and stored up in warehouses, but each of the neighbouring
people, as soon as the crops had been gathered into the barns,
bought whatever quantity he thought would suffice for his
household wants until the ensuing harvest, and removed it to his
own residence. The universal waste and improvident consumption
of grain during this season of abundance, led frequently to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
famines in other parts of the year, and many instances of that
punishment following such prodigality are related in the chronicle
before named. One notice, bearing the date 1044, says:—“This
year there was very great hunger all over England, and corn so
dear as no man ever remembered before; so that a sester of wheat
rose to sixty pence and even further.”</p>

<p>The ploughs of our forefathers were, as would naturally be
supposed, somewhat rude and clumsy in construction, differing
considerably in appearance, although not in their <i>modus operandi</i>,
from those which may be seen furrowing the same land in the
present day. Each plough was furnished with an iron share,
in front of which, attached to the extremity of a beam projecting
anteriorly, was a wheel of moderate diameter, its purpose being to
relieve the labour of the oxen and to facilitate the guiding of the
instrument, especially in turning. The oxen employed were
ordinarily four, and yoked to the plough by means of twisted
willow bands. Horses were prohibited by law from being used
on the land, but there must have been little need, one would
imagine, for a legal prohibition in the matter when it is
remembered that horses were nearly four times as valuable as
oxen, and that the latter were fully efficient at the task. The
month of January commenced their season for preparing the
ground, and during the period thus occupied the labours of the
ploughman began each morning at sunrise, when the oxen were
tethered and conducted to the fields, where the duty of the
husbandman was lightened by the assistance of a boy, who
superintended the cattle, driving or leading them whilst at work.
In the inclement months of winter these oxen were fed and
tended in sheds under the special care of the ploughman, but
during summer they shared a common lot with the other cattle
and were turned out to pasture in the fields, being transferred to
the charge of the cowherd. Other implements of husbandry in
use, in addition to the plough, were scythes, sickles, axes, spades,
pruning-hooks, forks, and flails, besides which the farmers
possessed carts and waggons of rather a cumbersome pattern.
It is doubtful whether the harrow was known here so early, but
opinion usually refers its introduction to a later date.</p>

<p>Of the moral tone of our Saxon settlers it is difficult to judge,
but that their business transactions were not always governed by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
a very strict sense of honour is intimated by the following
enactment, apparently framed to check repudiations of bargains
and, perhaps, to insure fair dealing:—“No one shall buy either
what is living or what is dead to the value of four pennies without
four witnesses either of the borough or of the village.” William
of Malmesbury, who wrote about a century after the Norman
Conquest, informs us that “excessive eating and drinking were
the common vices of the Saxons, in which they spent whole
nights and days without intermission.” It may, however, with
much probability be conjectured that not only is the statement in
some degree exaggerated, but that its application was designed
more particularly for the inhabitants of the larger towns than
those of comparatively sparsely populated districts like our own.
Nevertheless it cannot be claimed, with any show of reason, that
the small section of the nation established in the Fylde was
entirely uninfected by the vices which enervated and degraded
the wealthier and more populous regions of the kingdom. The
evil of intemperance in both food and drink, especially the latter,
pervaded the whole community, but as its indulgence required
both means and opportunity, its loathsome features were less
prominently visible in localities where these were scarce than in
others where they abounded. The Church used every effort to
awaken a better feeling in the minds of her degenerate sons,
and liberate them from the chains of a passion which had so
thoroughly enslaved them. Canons were directed against the
“sin of drunkenness,” and in order that no plea of ignorance
could be urged by any who had overstepped the bounds of sobriety,
a curious and minute description of the condition of body and
brain which constituted inebriation was appended to one of them,
as here quoted:—“This is drunkenness—when the state of the
mind is changed, the tongue stammers, the eyes are disturbed,
the head is giddy, the belly is swelled, and pain follows.” Ale
and mead were the beverages on which these excesses were committed,
and cow-horns the drinking cups. It would seem that
there was yet another national blemish, that of gambling, which
even invaded the cloister and threw its veil of fascination over
the clergy themselves, for a canon of the reign of Edgar ordered—“That
no priest be a hunter, or fowler, or player at tables, but
let him play upon his books, as becometh his calling.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span></p>

<p>Water-mills, planted on the banks of streams and consisting of
square weather-boarded structures, usually open at the top, were
the means possessed during the Saxon era for grinding the cereal
products of the Fylde. The wheel which received the pressure of
the current, and conveyed its motive power to the simple machinery
within the fabric, differed little from those still in use in various
parts of the country, one of which until recently was connected
with a small mill on the brink of the brook which drains the mere
at Marton into the river Wyre, and less than a century ago another
mill, situated in the township of Marton and worked on a similar
principle, was turned by a stream from the same mere. A water-mill
is at present in use near Great Eccleston. After the grinding
process had been completed the bran and flour were separated by
hand-sieves. About seventy or eighty years after the Normans
had settled in the district these primitive sheds were superseded
by a fresh species of mill, in which sails supplied the place of the
wheel, and another element was called into service. The new
erections were of wood, and separated from the ground by a pivot
of slight altitude, on which they turned bodily in order to be fixed
in the most favourable position for their sails to reap a full
harvest of wind. Solitary specimens of this early piece of
mechanical ingenuity are still visible hereabouts, but most of the
old mills were pulled down about a hundred years ago, or less, and
rebuilt with more stable material, whilst the modern improvement
of a revolving top only, did away with the necessity for the
venerable pivot, and allowed the foundations of the edifices to be
more intimately associated with mother earth than formerly.</p>

<p>Throughout the whole of the Saxon dynasty the mass of the
inhabitants would be what were termed the “villani,” that is, a
class forming a link between abject slavery and perfect independence.
They were not bound to any master but to the soil on
which they happened to be born, and on no plea were they
permitted to leave such localities. To the lord of the manor each
of the “villani” gave annually a certain portion of the produce
of the ground he tilled, but beyond that they acknowledged no
claim to the proceeds of their thrift by the large territorial
proprietors. When a manor changed ownership the “villani”
were transferred with it in exactly the same condition as before,
so that really they seem to have occupied the position of small<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
tenants paying rent in kind, with the important addition
that they were forced to pass their lives in the district where
they had first seen the light of day. It should be noted that
any “villani” not having domiciles of their own were compelled
to enter the service of others who were more fortunately
situated in that respect.</p>

<p>During the twelfth century the house-wife’s plan of preparing
bread for the table, in the absence of public bakehouses, common
in some neighbourhoods, was to knead the dough into large flat
cakes and lay them on the hearth in full glare of the fire, where
they were permitted to remain until thoroughly baked. Bread
from pure wheat of the best quality was a luxury unattainable
except by those of high station or wealth, the bulk of the people
having to content themselves with an inferior quality, brownish
in colour and made from rye, oats, and barley. The amount of
this indispensable commodity to be sold at a specified price was
regulated by law, and the punishments for not supplying the
proper measure, or for “lack of size” as it was termed, were—for
the first offence, loss of the bread; for the second, imprisonment;
and for the third, the pillory or tumbrel.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> In 1185 the maximum
charges to be made for certain provisions were settled by an act
which decreed that the highest price for a hen should be ½d., a
sheep 5½d., a ram 8d., a hog 1s., an ox 5s. 8d., and a cow 4s. 6d.</p>

<p>In the ensuing century no restrictions were placed upon the
tenants of the Fylde as to the course of husbandry to be pursued,
but each on renting his farm or parcel of ground cultivated it
according to the dictates of his own inclination or experience, the
only stipulation being that the soil should suffer no deterioration
from any ignorant or imprudent action on the part of the holder.
Oats and barley mixed, and a light description of wheat, very
inferior to the best grain, were the favourite crops, the former
being known as “draget,” and the latter as “siligo.” Arable land
was let at 4d. per acre, and the annual yield of each acre sown
with wheat, usually amounted to 12 bushels, the value of the grain
itself averaging about 4s. 6d. per quarter. Demand notices were
sent in two days after the rent had become due, and if not complied
with in two weeks the landlord distrained without further<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
ceremony; after an interval of another fortnight, if the money
still remained unpaid, the tenant was summarily ejected, and the
owner seized both farm and stock.</p>

<p>The meals consumed by the peasantry comprised only two during
the twenty-four hours, one, called dinner, being eaten at nine in
the morning, and the other, supper, at five in the afternoon. It
is very possible, however, that during the summer those farm
servants whose arduous duties were entered on at daybreak, partook
of some slight repast at an early hour of the morning, but the only
meals for which regular times were appointed were the two mentioned.
During harvest the diet of the labourers consisted for the
most part of herrings, bread, and an allowance of beer, whilst
messes of pottage were far from uncommon objects on the rustic
boards. Between the year 1314 and 1326 the prices of live stock
were again arranged, as under:—</p>

<p>In 1338 no domestic or husbandry servant residing in the
Hundred of Amounderness was allowed to pass beyond the
boundaries of the Wapentake on profession of going to dwell or
serve elsewhere, or of setting out on a pilgrimage, without bearing
with him a letter patent stating the reason of his departure and the
date of his return. This law, which applied to all Hundreds alike,
was intended to prevent the threatened decay of agriculture from
a dearth of labourers, who heretofore had been in the habit of
deserting their employment and wandering away into other
divisions of the country, where they supported an idle and
frequently vicious existence by soliciting alms and by petty thefts.</p>

<p>It will scarcely surprise the reader to learn that superstition was
rife amongst the populace during the periods so far noticed, and
that nothing was too absurd to be accepted as an omen, either of
good or evil, by our credulous forefathers. A timid hare encountered
in their walks abroad announced the approach of some unforeseen
calamity, as also did a blind or lame man, a woman with dishevelled
hair, or even a monk; whilst the visions of a wolf<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
crossing the path, St. Martin’s birds flying from left to right, a
humpbacked man, or the sound of distant thunder, were welcomed
as heralds of prosperity. All amusements were of an athletic
kind, and consisted of archery, casting heavy stones, spear darting,
wrestling, running, leaping, and sword and buckler playing. On
festivals, and occasionally at other seasons, the barbarous and
cruel sports of bull and bear-baiting were indulged in,<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> but cock-fighting
was considered, until a later epoch, an entertainment only
suitable for children, and on Shrove Tuesday each boy took his
pet bird to the school-house, which was for that day converted
into a cock-pit, superintended by the master.</p>

servants were:—</p>

<p>The statute which arranged the above rates of payment concluded
by saying that “such as deserve less shall take less, and also in places
where less is used to be given less shall be given from henceforth;”
so that the table just completed would seem to represent the
maximum rather than the ordinary scale of wages. This statute
also enacted that farm servants who purposed leaving their employers,
must engage themselves to other masters and give
reasonable warning before leaving their present ones, by which
idleness and mendicancy were effectually guarded against.</p>

<p>The common pastimes of the inhabitants during the fifteenth
and sixteenth centuries, in addition to some of those already<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
enumerated which still held their sway, were club, and trap-ball,
bowling, prisoners’-bars, hood-man blind, (a game similar to the
modern blindman’s-buff, but entered into by adults alone,) battledore
and shuttlecock, and during hard frosts skating, at first by
means of the shank bone of a sheep fastened on to the sole of the
boot and afterwards with iron-shod skates. Hawking and hunting
were confined to the families of position who resided at the ancient
Halls of the Fylde and to others of similar social standing,
forming but a small proportion of the entire population. At
Christmas the largest log obtainable was lighted on the hearth
and denominated the yule log. If the mass burned throughout
the night and the whole of the next day, it was regarded as an
omen of good fortune by the members of the household, but if it
were consumed or extinguished before that time had expired, it
was looked upon as auguring adversely for their prosperity. The
first Monday after Twelfth Day was called Plough Monday, a
name still familiar to many an old Fylde man, and was observed
as a general holiday by the men whose labours were associated
with that instrument, who on this day went about the villages
from house to house asking for plough-money to spend in
ale. Their processions, if such they could be called, consisted
of a plough, which was dragged along by a number of sword-dancers;
a labourer, dressed to resemble an old woman; and
another, who was clothed in skins, and wore the tail of some
animal hanging down his back. These two oddly garbed
individuals solicited small contributions from the people whilst
the remainder were engaged in dancing, and if anyone refused to
disburse some trifling sum when requested, they turned up the
ground fronting his doorway with the plough. During
Christmas week the country people blackened their faces, and thus
disguised committed all sorts of frolics and absurdities amongst
their neighbours. The chief rustic festival, however, was appointed
for the first of May, on which day the May-pole was drawn to the
village green by several oxen, whose horns were decorated with
bunches of flowers, and accompanied by a joyous band of revellers,
who after its erection on the accustomed site held their jubilee of
feasting and dancing around it. The pole itself was covered with
floral garlands, and streamed with flags and handkerchiefs from
its summit. A Lord and Lady, or Queen, of May were elected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
by a general vote, and to them belonged the honour of presiding
over the festivities. The costumes of these pseudo-regal
personages were liberally adorned with scarfs and ribbons, so that
their appearances should be in unison with the rest of the gay
preparations. The morris-dance formed an important feature of
the festival, and the performers in that somewhat vigorous
exercise wore richly decorated habits on to which small bells,
varying in tone, had been fastened. The new year was ushered
in with feasting and joviality, whilst friendly interchanges of
presents took place amongst all classes. In the evening, a huge
wassail-bowl filled with spiced ale was carried to the different
houses of the villages, and all who quaffed its exhilarating
contents drank prosperity to the coming year, and rewarded the
cup-bearers, usually female farm-servants, with some small
donation; the following carol in a more antique form, or some
similar one, was sung on the occasion:—</p>

<p>On Shrove Tuesday a barbarous custom prevailed of tying
cocks to a stake driven into the ground, and throwing at them
with sticks, until death ensued from repeated blows. St. Valentine’s
day received a merry welcome from the country swains
and maidens, who at that auspicious time made choice of, or more
properly speaking were mated to, their true loves for the year.
The all important selection was made by writing the names of an
equal number of each sex on separate slips of paper, and then
dividing them into two lots, one of which represented the males<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
and the other the females. The women drew from the male
heap, and the men from that of the females, so that each person
became possessed of two sweethearts, and the final pairing was
really the only element of real choice in the matter; in this the
men usually claimed the girl whom each of them had drawn, and
thus an amicable settlement was soon arrived at. After the
mirthful ceremony had been completed and each happy couple
duly united, the men gave treats and dances to their sweethearts,
and wore their billets for several days pinned on to their breasts
or coat sleeves. Another, and much simpler, plan of choosing a
valentine was to look out of the door or window on the eventful
morning, and the first person seen was regarded as the special
selection of the patron Saint, provided always the individual was
of the opposite sex, and unfettered by the silken bonds of Hymen.
Whitsun-ales and Easter-ales were assemblies held within, or in
the immediate neighbourhood of, the church-yards, at which the
beverage, giving the title to these festivities, was sold by the
clergy or their assistants, and consumed by the country people,
the proceeds being devoted to ecclesiastical purposes and the
relief of the poor. Wakes originated in an ancient custom of
gathering together on the evening before the birthday of a Saint
or the day appointed for the dedication of a church, and passing
the night in devotion and prayer. These watches, however, were
soon altered in character, and instead of religious exercises
employing the period of vigil, feasting and debauchery became the
recognized occupations.</p>

<p>The festival of Rush-bearing is of such antiquity that its origin
has become in a great measure obscured, but there is a strong
probability that the practice arose from a recommendation given
by Pope Gregory IV. to Mellitus, who was associated with St.
Augustine in christianising the inhabitants of England, to celebrate
the anniversaries of the dedications of those places of worship,
which they had rescued from Pagan influences, “by building
themselves huts of the boughs of trees about such churches, and
celebrating the solemnities with religious feastings.” The rush-cart,
decorated with flowers and ribbons, was paraded through
the village streets, accompanied by morris-dancers and others
bearing flags or banners. One of the mummers, dressed in a
motley suit, somewhat resembling that of a circus jester, jingled a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
horse-collar hung with bells, and kept up a constant succession of
small jokes at the expense of the bystanders as the procession
advanced. In early days before churches were flagged it was the
annual custom to strew their floors with rushes on the day of the
dedication of the sacred edifice, and in the parish register of
Kirkham we find, as follows:—“1604. Rushes to strew the
church cost this year 9s. 6d.” From the register at Poulton
church we have also extracted an entry, at random, from similar
ones occurring each year:—“Aug. 6th, 1784. To Edward
Whiteside for rushes, 6s. 8d.” The practice appears to have
arisen simply from a desire to promote warmth and comfort
within the churches by providing a covering for the bare earth,
and its connection with rush-bearing, when it existed, must be
regarded as having been purely accidental. Brand has discovered
another motive for rush-strewing, more especially in private
houses, and one not very flattering to our forefathers:—“As our
ancestors,” writes he, “rarely washed their floors, disguises of uncleanliness
became very necessary.” Erasmus, also, a Greek
Professor at Oxford in the time of Henry VIII., in describing the
hovels in which the agricultural labourers and others of the lower
classes lived, says:—“The floors are commonly of clay strewed
with rushes; under which lies unmolested an ancient collection
of beer, grease, fragments, bones, spittle, and everything that is
nasty.”</p>

<p>From 1589 to 1590 inclusive, the daily wages, without board,
of a ditcher were 4d., a thresher 6d., a hedger 4d., a gardener 10d.,
and a master-mason 14d. In 1533 it was enacted that no tenant
should hold more than two farms at once; and fifty-five years
later sundry penalties were imposed upon any one erecting
cottages for the agricultural population without attaching four
acres of land to each, also for allowing more than one family to
occupy a cottage at the same time.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> A law was passed in 1597,
directing that all houses of husbandry which had fallen into decay
within a period of seven years should be rebuilt, and from twenty
to forty acres of ground apportioned to each.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> The average yields
of grain per acre on well-cultivated soils during the latter half of
the sixteenth century were—wheat 20 bushels, barley 32 bushels,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
and oats 40 bushels. The subjoined tables contain the average
prices of some of the common articles of consumption:—</p>

<p>In 1581, the charge for shoeing a horse was 10d., and sometimes
12d. Here it may be noticed, although perhaps rather
digressive, that the herb tobacco was introduced into this country
sometime during the summer of 1586, by a party of Englishmen,
who for a short time colonised the island of Roanoak, near the
coast of Virginia, but, having quarrelled with the aborigines, were
removed home in the ships of Sir Francis Drake. Camden,
writing of these men, says:—“They were the first that I know of
that brought into England that Indian plant which they called
<i>tabacca</i> and <i>nicotia</i>, or <i>tobacco</i>, which they used against crudities,
being taught it by the Indians. Certainly, from that time
forward, it began to grow into great request, and to be sold at
a high rate; whilst in a short time many men, everywhere,
some for wantonness, some for health sake, with insatiable desires
and greediness, sucked in the stinking smoke thereof through an
earthen pipe, which presently they blew out again at their
nostrils; insomuch that tobacco-shops are now as ordinary in
most towns as tap-houses and taverns.”</p>

<p>The following rhymes, descriptive of the games and recreations
common in Lancashire amongst the youth of both sexes, were
written in 1600, by Samuel Rowland:—</p>

<p>Many of these games have long since become obsolete. Tick-tacke
resembled backgammon, but was rather more complicated;
seize-noddy, maw, and ruff were games of cards, the first being
somewhat similar to cribbage, while the two latter have no
modern representatives, although the expression <i>to ruff</i> is
frequently used at the whist-table; ‘cross and pile’ is merely an
earlier name of ‘pitch and toss’; and shoot-cock has been
modernised into shuttlecock.</p>

<p>During the seventeenth century occasional village fairs were
held in the Fylde, at which such uncouth games as “grinning
through a horse-collar,” as well as trials in whistling, etc., were
common amusements, while pedlars’ stalls, puppet shows, raffling
tables, and drinking booths were well attended by the holidaymakers.
At that period any damsel, wishing to learn something,
be it ever so little, of her future mate, was directed to run until
out of breath on hearing the first notes of the cuckoo, and on
removing her shoe she would find a hair of the same colour as
that of the husband whom fate had selected for her. On May-day
a snail placed upon the ashes of the hearth would trace the initial
letter, or letters, of the lover’s name; or the rind, peeled from an
apple and thrown backwards over the head, would by its arrangement
on falling to the ground effect a similar purpose:—</p>

<p>The following extracts from an “inventarye of all the goods and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
chattels of Peter Birket, late of Borrands,” taken after his decease
in 1661, will furnish a pretty accurate idea of the monetary worth
of certain articles of farming stock at that time:—“One outshoote
of hay, £1 6s. 8d.; one stack of hay without dores, 10s.; one
scaffold of hay, 10s.; one mare and one colt, £3; five geese, 4s.;
13 sheepe, £3; one cock and five hens, 2s.; one calfe, 10s.; two
heiffers, £3; one heiffer, £2; one cow, £2 10s.; another cow,
£3 10s.” Whether this gentleman was a fair representative of
his class or not we are unable to say, but if so, the small farmers
of Lancashire, to whom he appears to have belonged, were not
over indulgent in articles of dress or comfort, for the whole of
his wearing apparel was valued at no more than £1, whilst
his bedding realised only 5s.</p>

<p>In 1725 the Lancashire justices arranged and ordered that the

<p>They also appointed the hours of labour for those hired by the
day to be, between the middle of March and the middle of
September, from five in the morning until half-past seven in the
evening, and during the remainder of the year from sunrise to
sunset, resting half-an-hour at breakfast, an hour at dinner, and
half-an-hour at “drinking,” as the meal corresponding to our
“tea” was termed. “In the summer half,” added the magisterial
mandate, “the labourers may sleep each day half-an-hour; else
for every hour’s absence to defaulk a penny; and every Saturday
afternoon or eve of a holiday, that they cease to work, is to be

<p>From 1660 to 1690, the average price of mutton was 2d. per
pound; from 1706 to 1730, 2½d.; and from 1730 to 1760, 3d. per
pound. The prices of beef, veal, and lamb in 1710, were respectively
1⅒d., 2⅗d., and 2⁹⁄₁₀d., per pound.</p>

<p>During the eighteenth and earlier part of the nineteenth
centuries there was perhaps no pastime more popular amongst
the adult members of all classes than the callous sport of cock-fighting;
every village and hamlet in the Fylde had its pit, where
mains were held at all times and seasons. The following were
the rules pretty generally adopted in this neighbourhood for the
regulation of the contests:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging">“1.—To begin the main by fighting the lighter pair of cocks which fall in
match first, proceeding upwards towards the end, that every lighter pair
may fight earlier than those that are heavier.</p>

<p class="hanging">“2.—In matching, with relation to the battles, after the cocks of the main
are weighed, the match bills are to be compared.</p>

<p class="hanging">“3.—That every pair of equal weight are separated, and fight against others;
provided it appears that the main can be enlarged by adding thereto.”</p>

</div>

<p>Skippool was one of the favourite resorts for the gentry of our
district when wishful to indulge in their favourite amusement,
and frequent allusions to the cockpit there are to be found in the
journal of Thomas Tyldesley, of Fox Hall, as—“June 9, 1714,
... thence to Skipall, where at a cockin I meet with a deal
of gentlemen. Gave Ned M⸺y 1s. for his expenses; spent 1s.,
and won 2s. 6d. of Dr. Hesketh’s cockes.” In 1790 a notice
appeared in Liverpool that “The great main of cocks between
John Clifton, Esq., of Lytham, and Thomas Townley Parker,
Esq., of Cuerden, would be fought on Easter Monday, the 5th of
April, and the three following days, at the new cockpit in Cockspur
Street—to show forty-one cocks each. Ten guineas each battle,
and two hundred guineas the main.” The great-grandfather of
the present Lord Derby compelled each of his tenants to maintain
a game-cock for his benefit, and many were the birds supplied<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
from the Fylde to uphold his great reputation as a successful
cock-fighter.</p>

<p>One of the most ancient punishments amongst our forefathers
was that of the Brank or Scolds’ Bridle, a specimen of which was
possessed by Kirkham, and doubtless many others existed in the
Fylde. This instrument was but little removed in severity from
those implements of torture in vogue at the time of the Inquisition,
but differed from them in one important particular—it was
intended to control or silence, and not to stimulate, the tongue of
its victim. The Brank consisted of an iron framework, which
was fitted on to the head of the offender, usually some woman
whose intemperate language had incensed her husband; and a
metal spike, attached to the front of it, was so inserted into the
mouth that the slightest movement of the tongue brought that
sensitive organ in contact with its sharp edge or point. Doctor
Plott, who appears to have held the Brank in high estimation,
and to have considered it greatly superior to another mode of
correction, much in fashion during his day, says:—“This artifice
is much to be preferred to the ducking-stool, which not only
endangers the health of the party, but gives liberty of tongue
betwixt every dip.”</p>

<p>The Ducking-stool or Cuck-stool consisted of a substantial chair,
fastened to the extremity of a long pole, and suspended over a
pool of water. The middle of the pole rested on an upright post
near the edge of the pond, and was attached to it by means of a
pivot-hinge, so that the chair could be swung round to the side to
receive its victim, and, after being freighted and restored to its
original position, plunged into the water by raising the other end
of the shaft as often as those on the bank deemed it necessary to
cool the anger of the unfortunate scold. Several pools in
different parts of the Fylde still retain their names of Cucking-ponds,
and the last person condemned to suffer the barbarous
punishment was a young woman at Poulton, but she was happily
rescued by the kindly intervention of Madam Hornby, who
became surety for her good conduct in future.</p>

<p>In the belfry of Bispham church there formerly stood a plain-looking
wooden frame, which in earlier times had done duty as a
pennance-stool, but some years since the chair was removed, and
probably destroyed, as no trace of its existence has since been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
discovered. The last to perform pennance in this church and sit
upon the stool was a woman, who seems to have been living as
recently as 1836. A public pennance was exacted by the Church
from all frail maidens, who desired to obtain pardon for the sins
into which they had fallen. The ceremony consisted of parading
the aisles of the parish church with a candle in each hand, barefooted,
and clothed in white. Jane Breckal, of Poulton, was the
last to undergo the ceremony at that place, some time during the
ministry of the Rev. Thos. Turner, 1770 to 1810. The sobs and
cries of the unfortunate girl aroused the indignation of the
inhabitants against the pennance, and the cruel and degrading
exhibition was never repeated.</p>

<p>Riding Stang was another plan of punishment formerly inflicted
on quarrelsome or adulterous persons, and a woman named Idle,
of Great Layton, is mentioned as being the last of its victims in
that locality, and very likely in the whole of the Fylde. There
seem to have been two ways adopted of Riding Stang, one of
which was to mount the offending party or parties on a ladder,
supported at each end on the shoulders of one or sometimes two
men, and carry them about the neighbourhood for several hours,
accompanied by a band of men and boys beating tin kettles,
frying-pans, etc.; the other mode, and perhaps the more antique
one, was to place a youth astride a ladder, borne as in the previous
case, and arm him with a hand-bell, so that he was fully equipped
to undertake the duties of town crier. A procession was then
formed, and, amidst the discordant sounds of the instruments just
alluded to, paraded through the streets of the village, whilst the
crier, who usually did his part with great gusto, shouted out the
following doggrel rhymes, varying some portions of them when
occasion required:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Ran a dan, ran a dan, dan, dan,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But for ... has been banging his good dame.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He banged her, he banged her, he banged her, indeed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He banged her, poor woman, before she stood need;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For neither wasting his substance nor spending his brass,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But she was a woman, and he was an ass.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now, all good people that live in this row,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I would have you take warning, for this is our law,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And if you do your good wives bang,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For you three nights we will ride this stang.</div>
    <div class="verse indent22">Hurrah! hurrah!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span></p>

<p>When the offender happened to be some woman, who had
inflicted chastisement on the person of her spouse, the rhyme
was altered to suit her sex, and asserted that “he was a coward,
and she was an ass.” The remains of stocks in various states of
preservation, are still to be seen in many old villages, and
their use is of too recent a date to require any elucidation in this
volume.</p>

<p>On the fifth Sunday in Lent, Carling Sunday, the villagers
prepared a feast, consisting chiefly of peas, first steeped in water,
and afterwards fried in butter, which were eaten on the
afternoon of that day. Small troops or companies of pace-egg
mummers went from house to house in Passion week
enacting a short dramatic piece, and afterwards soliciting
money, or, in some cases, eggs, from their audience. The
<i>dramatis personæ</i> usually represented St. George, the champion
of England; a Turk, dressed in national costume; the
Doctor, of the quack fraternity; the Fool; and one or two others.
In the play, the Turk was wounded by St. George, and being left
for dead upon the field, guarded by the Fool, was restored to
health and strength by the Doctor, who opportunely arrived, and
concluded his self-laudatory harangue over the body of the
apparently defunct Turk, thus:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Here, Jack, take a little out of my bottle,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And let it run down thy throttle;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If thou be not quite slain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rise, Jack, and fight again.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Easter mumming is now rapidly becoming obsolete, and at
present amounts to nothing more entertaining than the recital of
a few weak, almost meaningless, rhymes, by, usually, five young
boys, decorated with ribbons and coloured paper, and supposed to
represent Lord Nelson, a Jack-Tar, a Lovely Youth, Old Toss-pot,
and Old Bessy Branbags.</p>

<p>“Lifting at Easter” was an old-established practice, existing in
the villages, of hoisting individuals in the air, either in a chair
or by any other means that might be convenient, until they
purchased their release by payment of a forfeit, generally some
small coin. On Ascension-day the parochial schoolmaster
conducted his pupils, armed with peeled willow wands, round
the limits of the parish, and each pupil struck the various<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
boundary marks with his stick as he passed them. All-Hallows’
E’en was the time when the young people tested the durability of
love or friendship by burning nuts:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Two hazel nuts I threw into the flame,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And to each nut I gave a sweetheart’s name:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This with the loudest bounce, me sore amazed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That in a flame of brightest colour blazed;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As blazed the nut, so may thy passion grow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For ’twas thy nut that did so brightly glow!”<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Other pastimes contributed to the evening’s amusement, such
as “ducking for apples,” and “snatch apple”—a tub, in the
former case, having been nearly filled with water, and the fruit
placed in it, each in turn, with hands bound behind them,
endeavoured to seize the prize with the teeth; in the latter game,
an apple was fastened to one extremity of a rod and a lighted
candle to the other, the whole being suspended by a string from
the ceiling, and the players, bound as before, snapped at the
apple, and avoided the flame as well as they were able.</p>

<p>Until within the last fifty or sixty years, the mosses of Marton
and the hills in the vicinity of the Fylde were illuminated with
bonfires on All-Hallows’ Eve, or Teanlay-night, as it was called,
kindled by the country people with the avowed object of succouring
their friends who were lingering in the imaginary regions
of a middle state. A field near Poulton received the name of
“Purgatory” from the mummery of the “Teanlays” having, on
one occasion at least, been celebrated there.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> This ceremony was
simple in its performance, and consisted merely of a circle of men
raising masses of blazing straw on high with pitch-forks. On All
Souls’ Day our Catholic forefathers were accustomed to bake cakes
of oatmeal and aromatic seeds, named Soul-cakes, and these,
together with pasties and furmety, formed a feast invariably eaten
at that season. Remnants of this custom existed even in late
years amongst the youths of Marton and some other townships and
villages, who on the day of ancient festival solicited money, under
the name of Soul-pence, from their neighbours.</p>

<p>We will now enumerate some of the superstitions and beliefs
that have prevailed in the Fylde more recently than those to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
which allusion has been made in the earlier part of the chapter.</p>

<p>The following adage, showing the signification of certain marks
on the nails, will probably be familiar to many of our readers, and
it is questionable whether, even yet, it is not regarded by a few of
the less enlightened of the peasantry as something more than a
mere saying:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Specks on the fingers,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fortune often lingers;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Specks on the thumbs,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fortune surely comes.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>No sick person could die if the bed or pillow upon which he lay
contained a pigeon’s feather; and, at an earlier date, the dwellers
near the coast firmly believed that life could only depart with the
ebbing tide. A horse-shoe nailed against the stable or barn-door,
or a broom-stick placed across the threshold of the dwelling,
prevented the entrance of witches or evil persons; also a hot
heater placed in the churn, and the mark of a cross, protected
respectively the cream and baking of dough from their presence.
The advent of guests was made known to the family circle by
certain conditions of the fire-grate; thus, a flake of soot hanging
from the topmost bar foretold a boy visitor, from the second a
man, from the third a woman, and from the fourth a girl. Cats
were popularly supposed to have the power of drawing the breath,
and as a natural consequence the life, out of children when asleep,
and for this reason great care was taken to exclude them from
bedchambers. Should a dark complexioned person be the first to
enter a dwelling on New Year’s morning, the household looked
forward with confidence to a prosperous year; but if the person
happened to be light, more especially if he had red hair, the omen
was regarded as unpropitious. Moon-beams shining through the
windows of bedrooms were considered injurious to the sleepers,
and even capable of distorting their features, or rendering them
imbecile. Children were taught to recite these simple lines
whenever the moon shone into their chambers:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I see the moon,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The moon sees me;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">God bless the priest</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That christened me.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A tooth, after extraction, was sprinkled with salt and thrown
into the fire in order to insure peace and comfort to the person<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
from whose mouth it had been removed. A pair of shoes placed
under the bed so that the tips of the toes alone were visible,
formed a certain remedy for cramp. Warts were removed by
rubbing them with a piece of stolen beef, which was afterwards
carefully and secretly buried to render the charm complete; a
snail hung on to a thorn was equally efficacious in removing these
excrescences, which gradually faded away as the snail itself melted
and vanished. A bag, containing small stones of the same number
as the warts, thrown over the left shoulder, transmitted them to
the person who had the misfortune to pick up the pebbles.
People labouring under attacks of ague, jaundice, or other
ailments, applied for relief to the wise-men of the neighbourhood,
who professed to cure them by incantations. The two following
receipts are taken from an old medical work, published as early as
1612, and in its time a highly popular authority on matters of
“Phisicke and Chirurgerie” amongst our rural populations:—</p>

<p>“Take an egg and breake it on the top, in such sorte that all the white and

be harde, and then burne it to ashes, and it will staunch the bleeding immediately
without all doubt.”</p>

<p>“A very good Medicine to staunch bloud when nothing else will do it, by
reason the veine is cut, or that the wound is greate.</p>

<p>“Take a Toade and dry him very well in the sunne, and then put him in a
linen Bagge, and hang him about the necke of him that bleedeth with a stringe,
and let it hange so low that it may touch his breaste on the left side neere unto
his hart, and commonly this will stay all manner of bleeding at the mouth, nose,
wound, or otherwise whatever. Probatum est.”</p>

</div>

<p>A woman named Bamber, living at Marton, attained to considerable
celebrity amongst the peasantry and others by her
skill in checking bleeding, which she is reported to have accomplished
by the utterance of some mystic words.</p>

<p>The people of the Fylde were not exempt from the common
belief in the miraculous power of the Royal touch in that
particular form of disease known as king’s evil, for amongst the
records of the Thirty-men of Kirkham is a notice that in 1632 a
sum of money was “given to Ricd. Barnes’s child, that had the
king’s evil, to help him up to London,” to be touched by
Charles I.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span></p>

<p>The fairies of the Fylde were supposed, like those of other
localities, to reside in the earth; the vicinity of a cold spring,
situated between Hardhorn and Newton, was one of their
legendary resorts, and from such reputation acquired the name of
“Fairies’ well.” Many stories are told of the mischievous, or
good-natured doings of these imaginary beings; one or two of
which we will here narrate:—A poor woman when filling her
pitcher at the above well, in order to bathe the weak eyes of her
infant, was gently addressed by a handsome man, who gave her a
small box of ointment, and told her at the same time that it would
prove an infallible remedy for the ailment of her child. The
woman, although grateful for the present, either overcome by that
irresistible curiosity which is commonly, but perhaps erroneously,
supposed to attach itself to her sex, or doubtful of the efficacy
which the stranger had assigned to the drug, applied it to one of
her own eyes. A few days afterwards she had occasion to go to
Preston, and whilst there detected her benefactor in the act of
stealing corn from the open mouths of some sacks exposed for
sale, and, having accosted him, began to remonstrate with him
on the wickedness of his proceedings, when he inquired with
evident surprise, how she became enabled to observe him, as he
was invisible to all else. She explained the use that had been
made of his ointment, and pointed to the powerful eye; but
hardly had the words been uttered and the organ of supernatural
vision indicated, before he raised his clenched hand, and with one
blow struck out the offending optic, or rather reduced it to a state
of total and irrecoverable blindness. Another anecdote refers to
a milkmaid, who, whilst engaged in her avocation, perceived a jug
and sixpence placed near to her by some invisible means; but no
way disconcerted by the singular event, and probably attributing
it to the agency of one of the elvan tribes, she filled the pitcher
with milk, and, having watched its mysterious disappearance and,
with unerring commercial instinct, pocketed the silver coin, took
her departure. This episode was repeated for many successive
mornings, until the maiden, overjoyed at her good fortune,
revealed the curious adventures to her lover, and from that hour
the hobgoblins appear either to have grown less thirsty, or,
annoyed at what they might consider the betrayal of their secret,
to have removed their custom to some other dairy, for neither<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
jug nor sixpence ever gladdened the morning labours of the milkmaid
again. A ploughman had his good nature, in cheerfully
repairing the broken “spittle” of a lady liberally rewarded.
The fairy, for such she proved to be, made known her presence
to the agriculturist by suddenly crying in a distressed tone—“I
have broken my speet,” and then held out in her hands the
useless instrument with a hammer and nails. No sooner had
she received her property, restored to a state of utility, than she
vanished into the earth, but not, however, without leaving a
substantial acknowledgment of his skill and kindness in the
palm of the astonished husbandman.</p>

<p>We can only discover a record of one witch in the Fylde; this
person of unenviable notoriety is stated to have had her abode in
Singleton, and to have been known to the villagers as Mag
Shelton. Her food, according to local tradition, was composed of
boiled groats mixed with thyme or parsley, and numerous are the
anecdotes related of her evil machinations and doings in the
neighbourhood—the cows of the country people were constantly
milked by her, whilst the pitcher walked before her in the form
of a goose; lives were blighted and prosperity checked by the
influence of her evil eye. Once, however, she was foiled by a girl,
who fastened her to a chair by sticking a bodkin, crossed with
two weavers’ healds, about her dress when seated before a large
fire.</p>

<p>Some idea of the spiritual condition of the peasantry may be
obtained from the perusal of the following prayer, a common one
amongst the children of the Fylde about one hundred years ago:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bless the bed that I lie on;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There are four corners to my bed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And four angels overspread,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Two at the feet and two at the head.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If any ill thing me betide,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Beneath your wings my body hide.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bless the bed that I lie on.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Bacon was considered to prove the finest and best if the hogs were
slaughtered before the moon began to wane, and in some month
whose name contained the letter R:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Unless your bacon you would mar</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Kill not your pig without the R.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span></p>

<p>The dumb-cake was made by unmarried women who wished to
divine the selection of fate as to their future husbands. The cake
was baked in strict silence by two maidens on Midsummer’s eve,
and afterwards broken into three pieces by another, who placed
one under each of their pillows; during sleep the expectant fair
ones were rewarded with a vision of their lovers, but the charm
was ruined if only a single word were spoken. Hemp-seed, also,
was sown by young maidens, who whilst scattering it recited the
words “Hemp-seed I sow, hemp-seed I hoe, and he that is my
true-love come after me and mow.” After repeating the rhyme
three times it was only necessary to look over the shoulder, and
the apparition of the destined swain would never fail to appear:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“At eve last Midsummer no sleep I sought,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But to the field a bag of hemp-seed brought;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I scattered round the seed on every side,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And three times, in a trembling accent cried:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">‘This hemp-seed with my virgin hand I sow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who shall my true love be the crop shall mow.’</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I straight looked back, and, if my eyes speak truth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With his keen scythe behind me came a youth.”<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A spinster who fasted on Midsummer’s eve, and at midnight laid
a clean cloth, with bread, cheese, and ale, and sat down to the
table as though about to eat, would be gratified with a sight of
the person to whom she would be married. This individual was
supposed to pass through the doorway, left open for the purpose,
as the clock struck twelve, and, approaching the table, to salute
his future partner with a bow and a pretence of drinking her
health, after which he vanished, and the maid retired to her
couch to rejoice or mourn, according as she admired or contemned
the prospect in store for her. Cuttings or combings from the hair
were thrown into the fire, and upon their blazing brightly or
smouldering away depended the duration of life likely to be
enjoyed by the person from whose head they had been taken.
Wishing-wells and gates were visited by credulous rustics, who
were anxious to make use of their mysterious power in obtaining
their desires in matters of love or business. The forefinger was
deemed venomous, and on that account children were instructed
not to spread salve or ointment with it.</p>

<p>About a century ago oats formed the chief production, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
nearly, if indeed not quite, the only grain crop cultivated in the
Fylde. When reaped, in harvest time, this commodity was
carried on the backs of pack-horses to the markets of Poulton,
Kirkham, Garstang, and Preston. The “horse bridge” between
Carleton and Poulton was originally a narrow structure, capable
only of affording passage to a single horse at once, and it was from
the practice of the farmers, with their laden cattle, crossing the
stream by its aid, when journeying to market, that the bridge
derived its name. These horses followed a leader ornamented
with a bell, and after they had arrived at their destination and
been relieved of their burdens, returned home in the same order
without a driver, leaving him to attend to his duties at the
market. The old bridge in use at the period to which we allude,
still exists, but is built over and hidden by the present erection.
Later experience has taught the agriculturist that the soil of the
Fylde is capable of producing, under proper tillage, other crops,
equal in their abundance to the one to which it appears formerly
to have been mainly devoted, and it would be difficult at the
present day to enumerate with accuracy the many and varied
fruits of the earth that have found a home in the Corn-field of
Amounderness.</p>

<p>We mentioned about the commencement of the chapter that
marl was in general use as a manure in the Anglo-Saxon era, and
here it is perhaps hardly necessary to state that this substance, so
rich in lime and so adapted for giving consistency to the sandy
soils, is still occasionally had recourse to by the husbandman.
Guano was first introduced into this country about the year 1842,
but it is probable that it was not commonly used in our district
until the beginning of 1845, when a cargo was imported from
Ichaboe to Fleetwood by Messrs. Kemp and Co., and offered for
sale to the farmers of the neighbourhood. Other cargoes followed.
Subjoined are arranged some tables showing the average market
values of certain productions of the Fylde in the two years given:—</p>

<p class="dropcap">The history of the dresses and costumes of the
inhabitants of the Fylde is interesting not only on
account of the multifarious changes and peculiarities
which it exhibits, but also as a sure indication of the
progress in civilisation, wealth, and taste, made in our section at
different eras. To Julius Cæsar we are indebted for our earliest
knowledge of the scanty dress worn by the aborigines of this
district, and from that warrior it is learnt that a slight covering
of roughly prepared skins, girded about the loins, and the
liberal application of a blue dye, called woad, to the rest of the
body constituted the sole requisites of their primitive toilets.
Cæsar conjectures that the juice or dye of woad was employed by
the people to give them a terror-striking aspect in battle, but here
he seems to have fallen into error, for the wars engaged in by the
Setantii would be confined to hostilities with neighbouring tribes,
stained in a similar manner, and it is scarcely reasonable to
suppose that either side would hope to intimidate the other by
the use of a practice common to both. A more probable explanation
of the custom is, that it was instituted for the ornamental
qualities it possessed in the eyes of the natives. Such a view
is supported by the remarks of Solinus, a Roman author, who
informs us that the embellishments usually consisted of the
figures of animals, “which grew with the growth of the body”;
and from this it is evident that before the frame had arrived at
maturity, in either youth or childhood, the skin was subjected to
the painful and laborious process of tattooing, for such according
to Isidore, appears to have been the nature of the operation. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
latter asserts that the staining was accomplished by squeezing out
the juice of the plant on to the skin, and puncturing it in with
sharp needles. When the Romans established a station at
Kirkham, and opened out the Fylde by means of a good road-way
to the coast, the Setantii modified their wild uncultivated habits,
and, taking pattern from the more civilised garb of their
conquerors, adopted a covering for the lower limbs, called <i>brachæ</i>,
hence the modern breeches, whilst many of the chiefs were not
long before they strutted about in all the pride of a <i>toga</i>, or gown.
About four hundred years later, when the Anglo-Saxons had
taken possession of the soil of the Fylde, and had either
appropriated the deserted settlements and renamed them, or
reared small and scattered groups of dwellings of their own, a
marked change became visible in the nationality, character,
and costumes of the people. No longer the semi-civilised and
half-clad Briton was lord of the domain, but the more refined
Saxon with his linen shirt, drawers, and stockings, either of
linen or woollen, and bandaged crosswise from the ankle to the
knee with strips of leather; over these a tunic of the same
material as the stockings was thrown, and reached as low as the
knees, being plain or ornamented according to the means or rank
of the wearer. This garment was open at the neck and for a
short distance over the chest; the sleeves, extending to the wrists,
were generally tight, and a girdle frequently, but not universally,
confined the gown round the waist. In addition a small cloak
was worn for out-door purposes over the tunic, and fastened on
the breast or shoulder with brooches or clasps. The shoes of the
Saxon settlers were open down the instep, where they were laced
or tied with two thongs. Even the very lowest of the population,
although poverty might reduce them to miserable straits, seldom,
if ever, went barefooted. Caps, on the contrary, were not in great
request, and rarely to be seen, unless on the heads of some of
the more affluent. Our female ancestors at that era were habited
in a close-fitting dress, falling to the feet and furnished with tight
sleeves, reaching as far as the wrists, over which was placed a
shorter gown with loose open sleeves. Their head-dress was
simply a strip of linen of sufficient length to wrap round the
temples and fall on the neck. Amongst the wealthiest of the
nation a flowing mantle, ornaments of precious metal, and sable,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
beaver, and fox furs were common, but the inhabitants of the
Fylde, being of less exalted social standing, were obliged to
content themselves with the skins of lambs and cats by way of
adornment. The inferior farm servants, called serfs, amongst
whom many of the vanquished Britons would be classed, were
seldom indulged by their masters with more than a coat, a pair
of drawers, and sandals, the shirt, we presume, being deemed ill
suited to their positions of servitude and dependence.</p>

<p>The colonisation of the Danes, whatever effect it may have had
upon the habits and condition of the people, exercised no lasting
influence upon their dress, and it was not until half a century after
the Norman baron, Roger de Poictou, had parcelled out the
land amongst his tenants, that the bulk of the males were induced,
by the example of the new-comers, to display their taste in the
choice of a head-covering. Many varieties were daily open to
their inspection on the brows of the Norman landholders and
servants, but the diffidence, let us hope, of the now humbled
Saxons suggested the adoption of an exceedingly plain flat species
of bonnet, which speedily became the common cap of the district.
The ladies, however, with a greater aptitude for rising superior to
disappointment and affliction, were not dilatory in benefitting by
the superior style of the fair partners of their conquerors, and
soon, putting aside all semblance of depression, appeared in long
cuffs, hanging to the ground from their upper dress sleeves and
tied in a large knot; their kerchiefs, also, whose modest proportions
had formerly served only to encircle the forehead, were
now extravagantly lengthened and fastened in a similar manner.
As years rolled on and fashion began to assert her sway with a
greater show of authority, the shoes of the men underwent certain
changes, becoming more neat in workmanship and having the
toes somewhat elongated and pointed, whilst the richer of the
gentry, chiefly Normans, wore short boots reaching a little
distance up the calf. In the early part of the thirteenth
century the female head-dresses consisted of nets, made from
various materials, in which the hair was confined; and the trains
of the gowns were lengthened. Later in the same era cowls or
hoods, twisted and pinned in fanciful shapes, adorned the heads
of the ladies, and formed the main feature of their walking
costumes. Aprons also came up at that period. The dress of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
the men underwent no alteration of any moment until the first
half of the fourteenth century, when the manorial lords of the
neighbourhood, and others of the inhabitants, discarded the cloaks
and tunics of their forefathers, and substituted in their stead a
close-fitting outer garment of costly and handsome material,
scarcely covering the hips, immediately above which it was
surrounded by a girdle. The sleeves usually terminated at the
elbows, and from there long white streamers depended, whilst the
sleeves of an under dress reached to the wrists, and were ornamented
with rows of buttons. A long cape and cowl was the
general overcoat. The most characteristic dress of the ladies was
a habit cut away at the sides so as to expose the under skirt,
which was invariably of rich and fine texture. The long white
streamers, just alluded to, were part of the female as well as the
male attire, and the borders of the habit were bound with fur or
velvet. We may mention that an English beau of that era wore
long pointed shoes, the toes of which were connected with the
knees by gold or silver chains, a long stocking of different colour
on each leg, short trowsers, barely extending to the middle of the
thigh, a coat, half of which was white and the other blue or some
equally bright colour, and a silken hood or bonnet, fastened under
the chin, embroidered with grotesque figures of animals, and
occasionally decked with gold and precious stones. Lest,
however, the reputations of our ancestors should suffer in the
eyes of the present generation from the existence in their age
of the absurdity here pictured, it is our duty and pleasure to
assure all readers that such parodies on manhood were strictly
confined to the populous cities, and that there is no probability of
even a solitary specimen ever having desecrated the modest soil
of the Fylde.</p>

<p>During the greater portion of the succeeding cycle of a hundred
years a species of cloth turban was much in favour amongst the
male sex of the middle and upper classes, from one side of which
a length of the same material hung down below the waist, and was
either thrust between the girdle and the coat, or wrapped round
the neck as a protection from cold. Faces were cleanly shaved,
and hair cut as close to the scalp as possible; hitherto, from about
the date of the first arrival of the Normans, the practice had been
to allow the latter to grow long and to wear the beard. The hose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
were long and tight. The boots were either short, or reached
half-way up the thighs, both kinds being long toed. Occasionally
a single feather relieved the plainness of the turban-shaped cap.
The ordinary dress of the gentlewomen was a full trained robe or
gown, made high in the neck, and sometimes, with a fur or velvet
turn-over collar, its folds at the short-waist being confined by
means of a simple band and buckle. Coiffures were mostly heart-shaped,
but in some rare instances horned. The sleeves of the
above costume were, shortly after its institution, lengthened and
widened to a ridiculous extent. Towards the end of the particular
era of which we are writing trains were discontinued, and broad
borders of fur substituted, whilst round tapering hats, two feet
in height, with loose kerchiefs floating from the apex, came
much into favour. The last few years of the fifteenth and the
earliest ones of the sixteenth centuries were marked by great
changes in the male attire; the Butlers, Cliftons, Carletons,
Westbys, Allens, Molyneux, and many others of the gentry of
the neighbourhood, figured at that period in fine shirts of long
lawn, embroidered with silk round the collar and wristbands, a
doublet with sleeves open at the elbows to allow the shirt to
protrude, a stomacher, over which the doublet was laced; a long
gown or cloak, with loose or hanging sleeves and broad turn-over
collar of fur or velvet; long hose or stockings; broad-toed shoes
for ordinary use, and high boots, reaching to the knees, for riding
purposes; and broad felt hats, or variously shaped caps of fur or
velvet, adorned with ostrich or other feathers. The hair was
permitted to grow enormously long and fall down the back and
over the shoulders, but the face was still cleanly shaved, with the
exception of military and aged persons, who wore mustaches or
beards. The wives and daughters, belonging to such families as
those alluded to, were habited in upper garments, cut square at
the neck, and stomachers, belts, and buckles, or costly girdles
with long pendants in front. The sleeves were slit at the elbows
in a manner similar to those of the men. High head-dresses were
abandoned, and a cap or caul of gold net or embroidery, which
allowed the hair to flow beneath it half way to the ground, took
their place. Turbans, also, were fashionable for a brief season.
The females of a humbler sphere wore plain grey cloth gowns,
ornamented with lambs’ skin or wool, and cloaks of Lincoln<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
green; the appearance of such an one upon a holiday is described
by Skelton, the laureate of Henry VII., as under:—</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">With her blanket hose,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her shoone smeared with tallow.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the following reign, the commonalty, in imitation of the
example set by the resident squires in this and other parts of the
kingdom, became so extravagant in their ideas of suitable habiliments
that Henry VIII. issued an edict, prohibiting them from
wearing ornaments of even the most simple description, and
confining them to the use of cloth at a certain fixed price, and
lambs’ fur only. At the same time, velvets of any colour, furs of
martens, chains, bracelets, and collars of gold were allowed only
to those who possessed an income of not less than two hundred
marks per annum; but the sons and heirs of such were permitted
to wear black velvet or damask, and tawny-coloured russet or
camlet. None but those in the yearly receipt of one hundred
marks could venture on satin or damask robes. The dress which
may be taken as the most characteristic garb under the sovereignty
of the last Henry and of his two immediate successors,
comprised a doublet with long bases, or skirts, and extensive
sleeves, over which was thrown a short cloak, provided with armholes
for the passage of the doublet sleeves. The cloak had a
wide rolling collar, made of velvet, fur, or satin, according to
taste. The shirt was plaited, and embroidered with gold, silver,
or silk. The hose were closely fitted to the limb, being in some
cases long and entire, and in others divided, under the names of
the upper and nether stocks. Slashed shoes, or buskins of velvet
and satin, with broad toes, and a cap of one of sundry forms,
either simply bordered, or laden with feathers, completed the
costume of every male member of the numerous families inhabiting
the ancient halls of this section. Sir Walter Scott, who is
generally allowed to have been pretty correct in the costumes of
his heroes and minor characters, has described the appearance of
a yeoman of our county about the middle of the sixteenth century
as follows:—</p>

<p>Shortly after the accession of Queen Elizabeth in 1558, remarkable
alterations became evident in the fashions of the inhabitants.
The skirts of the doublet were reduced to much smaller dimensions,
so as thoroughly to expose the upper stocks, which, under
the new title of trunk-hose, had risen to a very important
place in the toilet. French trunk-hose were the first to render
themselves conspicuous in our locality, and consisted of two
varieties, the former of which were short, round, and full,
becoming, in fact, in course of time, so swollen by padding that
their use was abandoned by universal consent; and the second
variety, going to the other extreme and fitting tightly to the
limb, introduced. The next to arrive were the Gallic hose, very
large and wide, and extending to the knee only; after which came
the Venetian hose, reaching below the knee to the garter, where
they were secured with silken bands. The trunk-hose, of every
kind, were made of silk, velvet, satin, or damask. The nether
stocks, or stockings, were of jarnsey, thread, fine yarn, and later,
of silk, whilst the shoes partook more of the nature of slippers,
and were variously decorated. Ruffs encircled the necks of the
males as well as the females. Above the doublet was worn in the
Spanish style a cloak of silk, velvet, or taffeta, and of a red, black,
green, yellow, tawny, russet, or violet colour, many being
bordered with long glass beads. Hats were conical and high, flat
and broad, and flat and round, but in all cases were made of velvet
or sarcenet, and ornamented with bunches of feathers. The robes
of the ladies, made of bright-coloured velvet, silk, or fine cloth,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
had both tight and wide sleeves, and were branched or opened at
the front of the skirt to expose the handsome petticoat beneath.
The farthingale distended the dresses of our female ancestry from
just below the bodice or stomacher, in a manner that few, we
opine, of the fair sex would care to see revived at the present day.
The ruff was of cambric or lawn, and when first introduced,
moderate in its proportions, but like many other fashions of that
epoch, became enlarged into an absurdity as years passed on.
The hair of the ladies was curled, crisped, and arranged with
most elaborate care; indeed, so curious and changeable were the
coiffures that it would be tedious to our readers to offer more than
this general description of them. Capes falling but a short way
beyond the shoulders, and faced with fringe or velvet, were also
worn. The costume of the gentlewomen during the seventeenth
century, if the sombre garbs of the Roundhead families be
excepted, consisted of an upper gown, which comprised a bodice
and short skirt, the former being open over a laced stomacher,
and the latter divided anteriorly, and its sides drawn back
and looped up behind; a petticoat or under-dress, of expensive
material, reaching to the ground; a yellow starched neckerchief,
overspreading the shoulders and terminating on the bosom in two
pointed ends; and a high crowned hat, beneath which long
ringlets escaped and flowed down the back. The peasant girls or
female farm servants had plain dresses, falling to the ankles, and
usually tight sleeves and aprons. The bodices of some were open
to the waist, but the stomachers, although laced, were of a very
inferior kind, and the starched neckerchiefs were wanting. The
gentlemen of the Fylde were influenced in their choice of garments
according as their sympathies were with the King or
Parliament, but there can be little question that in a locality so
staunchly loyal as our own, the picturesque garb of the Cavaliers
would predominate over the affectedly modest and plain attire of
the partizans of Cromwell. The existence on the soil of such men
as Sir Thomas Tyldesley, Thomas Singleton of Staining Hall,
Thomas Hesketh of Mains Hall, who laid down their lives in the
service of the crown, and numbers of others, who drew the
sword in the cause of the throneless monarch, are fair evidence
that the above conjecture is not hazarded without good reason.
A doublet of silk, satin, or velvet, with large wide sleeves slashed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
up the front; a collar covered by a band of rich point lace, with
Vandyke edging; a short cloak, thrown on one shoulder; short
trousers, fringed and reaching to the wide tops of the high boots;
a broad-leaved Flemish beaver hat, with a plume of feathers and
band; and a sword belt and rapier, constituted the full costume
of a Cavalier. Instead of the velvet doublet, a buff coat, richly
laced, and encircled by a broad silk or satin scarf, fastened in a
bow, was substituted when the inhabitants were under the
excitement produced by actual war, in which so many took part.
The hair, it should be mentioned, was worn long by the Cavaliers,
and closely cropped by the Roundheads, whose dress offers no
special features to our notice.</p>

<p>In the earlier part of last century the occupiers of Layton,
Lytham, Fox, Burn, Mains, Rawcliffe, Rossall, Larbrick, etc.,
Halls, and others of equal social standing, who formed the gentry
of the Fylde, and who consequently must be taken as our mirror
of fashion, were clothed in straight square-cut waistcoats, extending
to the knees, and of very gorgeous patterns; velvet breeches
fastened below the knees; long silk stockings; buckled shoes,
with high red heels; periwigs of monstrous size; hats, cocked on
three sides; long lace neckerchiefs; and lastly, but far from the
least important, a coat of rich material, having long stiff skirts
and wide cuffs, turned back and adorned with gold or silver lace.
The ladies had laced stomachers beneath a bodice with straight
sleeves, ending at the elbow in moderately wide cuffs. The skirt
of the dress was divided in front and looped up behind, disclosing
a petticoat equalling or surpassing the richness of the upper
garment, and trimmed with flounces and furbelows. The boots
resembled those just described, but were more delicate in workmanship.
The head-dress was composed of a species of cap, the
lace material of which rose in three or four tiers, placed one above
another, almost to a point, whilst the hair was brushed up and
arranged in stiff curls, somewhat resembling a pyramid. This
coiffure had only a brief reign, and was superseded by one less
exalted, and of more elegant appearance. Hoops were introduced
about 1720, and thirty years later silk aprons and gipsy straw hats,
or small bonnets, were worn. In 1765 periwigs were discarded, and
the natural hair was allowed to grow, being profusely sprinkled
with powder, both by males and females. The country people<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
were habited in long, double-breasted coats, made from frieze or
homespun, and of a dark brown, grey, or other quiet shade; a
light drugget waistcoat, red shag or plush breeches, and black
stockings. There is no necessity to trace the costumes of our
ancestors further than the point here reached, as their varieties
present few phases of special interest, and probably the most
striking are already sufficiently familiar to our readers. A sure,
though somewhat unsteady, decline was shortly inaugurated in
the sumptuous and elaborate dresses of the people, which
continued its course of reform until the more economical and
unostentatious dress of modern days had usurped the place of the
showy habiliments of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Country</span> or district of the Fylde may be briefly described
as broad and flat, for although in many places it is raised in gentle
undulations, no hill of any altitude is to be seen upon its surface.
The fertility of its soil has long been acknowledged, and a visit to
its fruitful fields during the warm months of summer would
disclose numbers of rich acres yellow with the ripening grain,
while potatoe and bean-fields, meadow and pasture-lands, orchards
and fruit gardens, are scattered over the wide area. Our design
in the present instance is not, however, to enlarge upon these
cultivated features, but to notice some of the more striking
natural peculiarities, and to arrange in a classified list sundry of
the rarer wild plants growing in the neighbourhood, enumerating
also the different birds and sea-fowl, which are either natives or
frequenters of the locality.</p>

<p>The features most calculated by their singularity to attract the
attention of the stranger on surveying this division of the county
are the moss-lands, the sand-hills, the mere at Marton, and the
stunted appearance and inclination from the sea of those trees
situated anywhere in the vicinity of the coast.</p>

<p>The great moss of the Fylde lies in the township of Marton,
and extends six miles from north to south, and about one mile
from east to west. On examining the structure of this moss,
below the coarse herbage covering its surface, is discovered
a substance called peat, brown and distinctly fibrous at its upper
part, but becoming more and more compact as we descend, until
at the bottom is presented a firm, dark-coloured, or even black
mass, betraying less evidence, in some cases barely perceptible, of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
its fibrous formation. Beneath the peaty layer is a thick bed of
clay, having imbedded in it, either partially or wholly, large
trunks of trees—oak, yew, fir, etc., which, by their frequency and
arrangement, show that at some period the extensive tract must
have been a dense woodland, but at what particular era it is
impossible, with any degree of exactness, to determine. The
disinterment, however, of certain Celtic relics from the substance
of the peat, which may be supposed to have belonged to the
aboriginal Britons of the section, inclines us to the opinion that
the lower layers of the moss were formed, and consequently the
forest overthrown, anterior to the Roman occupation of our island,
but how long before that time it was standing, must remain
purely a matter of conjecture, unless some reliable proofs of its
more precise antiquity are disclosed during operations in the turf.
The manner in which the demolition of the forest was effected is
also somewhat wrapt in obscurity, although it is probable that
the noble trees of which it was composed were overturned and
uprooted by the fury of some wide-spread inundation or the
violence of some terrific hurricane. The fearful devastations,
both or either of the elements here brought into action can
accomplish, are too well marked in the histories of other countries
for us to hesitate in ascribing to them the power of overthrowing,
under similar turbulent conditions, even so substantial an obstruction
as the forest must have been; but a careful study of the
locality and of the several sudden incursions of the tide which
have occurred during recent years, leads to the belief that the sea
was the chief destructive agent, and that the gale which hurled
the raging volumes of water over the low-lying lands at the south
of Blackpool, and the then level wooded tract beyond, assisted only
in the ruinous work. In support of such a hypothesis may be
instanced the flood of 1833, when a tide, only estimated to rise to
a height of sixteen feet, but greatly swollen by a furious storm
from the south-west, burst over at that spot, swept away several
dwelling-houses in its course, battered down the hedges, and laid
waste the fields far into the surrounding country. Had this
inundation occurred during the high spring tides, it is impossible
to say to what extent its ravages might have been carried, but the
incident as it stands, being within the recollection of many still
living, and by no means a solitary example of the usual direction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
taken by the storm-driven waves, furnishes an apt illustration of
the most natural way in which the downfall of the forest may
have been accomplished. The Rev. W. Thornber, who has
bestowed much time and labour on the subject, says:—“There
are some facts that will go far to prove that these forests, once
standing on Marton Moss, were overthrown by an inundation of
the sea, viz., every tree on the Moss, as well as the Hawes, lies
in a south-eastern direction from the shore; and the bank, which
appears to have been the extent of this irruption, commencing at
the Royal Hotel, runs exactly in the same direction. The shells,
similar to those collected on the shore, intermixed with wrack of
the sea, which are found in abundance under the peat, also
corroborate this supposition. Moreover the tide is constantly
depositing a marine silt similar to that which lies beneath the
peat, and in some instances upon it.”</p>

<p>The wreck of such a vast number of trees would cause a great
but gradual alteration in the surface of the ground. The masses
of fallen timber, blocking up the streamlets and obstructing
drainage, would create a more or less complete stagnation of
water upon the land; the bark, branches, and leaves undergoing
a process of decay would form the deepest layers of the peat;
rank herbage and aquatic plants springing up and dying in endless
succession, would form annual accumulations of matter, which in
course of time would also be assimilated into peat, and in this
manner the moss overlaying the original clayey surface and
burying the ancient forest, would grow step by step to its present
dimensions. Again, each layer of peat, as they were successively
formed, would press upon those beneath, so that the weight of its
own increase would give firmness and solidity to the substance of
the moss. Thus we see that the whole secret of the creation or
formation of the moss is simply a process of growth, decay, and
accumulation of certain vegetable products annually repeated.
The huge moss of Pilling and Rawcliffe owes its existence to
similar phenomena.</p>

<p>The large mounds, or star-hills as they are called, which
undulate the coast line from Lytham to South-Shore, are composed
simply and purely of sand, covered over with a coarse
species of herb, bearing the name of star-grass. Similar eminences
at one time occupied the whole of the marine border of the Fylde,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
but in many places the encroaching tide has not only annihilated
the hills themselves, but even usurped their sites. The town of
Fleetwood is erected on a foundation of sand, and several
extensive mounds of that nature exist in its vicinity. Below this
light superficial substance, in some places very deep and thrown
into its elevated forms by the long-continued action of the wind,
is a subsoil resembling that found in other parts of the Fylde,
and consisting of a clayey loam and alluvial matter. The
diminutive size of those trees growing near the coast is due both
to the openness and bleakness of the site, and the deleterious
effects of the saline particles contained in the air; whilst the
peculiar leaning from the water of their branches, and in many
instances their trunks, is caused by the mechanical action or
pressure of the strong winds and sea breezes prevailing from the
west during three-fourths of the year.</p>

<p>Marton Mere, situated in the township indicated by its name,
was formerly a lake of no inconsiderable extent, but drainage and
the accumulation within its basin of sediment have reduced it to
its present comparatively unimportant dimensions. Traces of the
more extensive boundaries of the sheet of water in former days
are still discernible along its banks, and at one time, it is stated,
the wheel of a water-mill near to the village of Great Marton,
was turned by a stream from the mere. The right of fishery in
the lake, for such it was in the earlier periods, was the subject of
legal contest in the reign of Edward III., and in 1590 John
Singleton, of Staining Hall, held the privilege.</p>

<p>There are few districts of similar area which can boast so
many and such interesting varieties of the feathered tribes, either
natives or visitants, as the Fylde. Some of the rarest sea-fowl
are occasionally seen along the coasts, while the fields and hedgerows
abound with most of the melodious songsters of our island.
Amongst the number of both land and sea birds which have been
observed in the neighbourhood, either during the whole year or
only in certain parts of it, may be mentioned the following:—</p>

<p>The fertile fields and sunny lanes of the Fylde afford ample
opportunity for the botanist to indulge in his favourite pursuit, and
a short ramble over any portion of the pleasant country will
unfold to his inquiring gaze many of Nature’s most beautiful and
interesting offsprings. Specimens, especially of the maritime
varieties of several of the floral families, unobtainable in the
inland districts, may here be found lightly planted on the loose,
sandy margins of the shore. In the context it is not intended to
enter into a description of the different plants or of the localities
in which they may most commonly be found, but merely to
enumerate some of the more important ones; and in the following
list all those inhabitants of the district, which are likely to
interest the student of Botany or lover of Nature, are arranged in
their various groups or orders:—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The River Wyre</span> rises in the hills of Wyersdale and
Bleasdale; running in a south-westerly direction and passing
the towns of Garstang and Church Town, it arrives at St.
Michael’s, from which point its tortuous course is continued
almost due west as far as Skippool. Thence winding past the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
ancient port of Wardleys, the stream, much widened, flows
north and a little inclined towards the west, until it reaches
the harbour of Fleetwood, situated at its mouth. From that
seaport, the channel of the river, unaltered in direction, lies for a
distance of nearly two miles between the sand-banks of North
Wharf and Bernard’s Wharf, and finally terminates in Morecambe
Bay, meeting the well-defined bed of the Lune at right
angles. The origins of the Wyre in the hills consist of two small
rivulets, and the stream formed by their union is joined near
Scorton by the Grizedale Brook, whilst lower down, about two
miles beyond the town of Garstang, it receives the Calder,
rising on the slopes of Bleasdale. Before leaving the parish of
Garstang, the Wyre is further increased by the brook springing
from Fairsnape and Parlick Pike, which passes Claughton and
Myerscough, not far from where it receives a small tributary from
the south. At Skippool also a brook, the Skipton, which springs
from the mere and marshy grounds of Marton Moss, pours its
contents into the river.</p>

<p>The Wyre is crossed at Garstang by the aqueduct of the
Preston, Lancaster, and Kendal canal, and at St. Michael’s, near
the Church, it is spanned by a rather narrow but substantial
stone bridge. For a distance of about six miles in the neighbourhood
of the latter place the stream is enclosed within artificial
banks, which in some parts have a descent of thirty feet. In
spite of these precautions, however, high floods occasionally occur,
when the swollen waters burst over the embankments and inundate
the adjoining country. At Cart Ford there is a wooden structure
of very limited width, connecting the opposing banks; and a few
miles further down is the Shard Bridge, built of iron, and presenting
a neat and elegant appearance. The river at that spot is 500
yards in breadth, and until the erection of the bridge in 1864,
was crossed by means of a ferry-boat, or forded at low water by
carts and conveyances. The ancient name of this ford was
Ald-wath, and we learn from the following entry in the diary
of Thomas Tyldesley, that in 1713 the charge for crossing by boat
was 6d. each journey:—“September 14, 1713.—Went after dinr. to
ffox Hall; pd. 6d. ffor boating att Sharde; saw ye ferry man
carry out of ye boat a Scot and his pack, a sight I never saw
beffor, beeing 56 years off age.”</p>

<p>About three hundred years since the venerable Harrison
described the principal rivers of Lancashire, and from his
writings at that time we quote as under:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Wire ryseth eight or ten miles from Garstan, out of an hill in Wiresdale,
from whence it runneth by Shireshed chappell, and then going by Wadland,
Grenelaw Castle (which belongeth to the erle of Darbie), Garstan and Kyrkeland
hall, it first receiveth the seconde Calder, that commeth down by Edmersey
chappell, then another chanel increased with sundrie waters, the first water is
called Plympton brooke. It riseth south of Gosner, and commeth by Craweforde
hall, and eare long receyving the Barton becke, it proceedeth forward till it
joyneth with the Brooke rill that commeth from Bowland Forest by Claughton
hall, where M. Brokehales doth live, and so throw Mersco forest. After this confluence
the Plime or Plimton water meeteth with the Calder, and then with the
Wire, which passeth forth to Michael church and the Rawcliffes, and above
Thorneton crosseth the Skipton, that goeth by Potton, then into the Wire rode,
and finally into the sea, according to his nature.”</p>

</div>

<p>Drayton also has left the subjoined versified account of the
Wyre, and as in addition to its poetic merit, it possesses the
virtue of being a faithful description, we need not apologise for
giving it unabridged:—</p>

<p>White Hall, (formerly Upper Rawcliffe Hall,) Rawcliffe Hall,
and Mains Hall, each of which will claim our attention more
particularly hereafter, are seated on the banks of the Wyre, so
also is the ancient house of Preesall-with-Hackensall, and although
not properly comprised within the limits of this work, it has a
right from its association with the river, to some description—a
right the more readily conceded when it is known that in point
of antiquity and interest, the hall and domain are well deserving<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
of our consideration. The site of the mansion is a little removed
from the brink of the stream, and almost directly opposite the
southern extremity of Fleetwood. The present building is of
considerable age, having been erected by Richard Fleetwood, of
Rossall, in 1656, as indicated by an inscription over the main
entrance, but there can be no question that the origin of its
predecessor was co-eval, at least, with the grant of the manor by
King John, when earl of Moreton, to Geoffrey, the Crossbowman,
who, with his descendants, resided there. The whole of the large
estate remained in the family of Geoffrey until the fifteenth
century, when it was conveyed in marriage to James Pickering,
of Layton, by Agnes, the sole offspring and heiress of the last
male Hackensall, the title assumed, according to custom, by the
Crossbowman. James Pickering left at his decease four daughters,
co-heiresses, and married to Richard Butler, of Rawcliffe, Thomas
Aglionby, Nicholas Aglionby, and James Leybourne, each of
whom inherited one-fourth of the manor in right of his wife. In
1639 Sir Paul Fleetwood, of Rossall, held three-fourths of
Hackensall, whilst the remaining quarter had descended to
Henry Butler. Under the will of Richard Fleetwood, the
re-erector of the hall, at that time occupied by his brother
Francis, the three-fourths just named were sold by his trustees,
being purchased, in part, for the Hornbys, of Poulton. Geoffrey
Hornby, vicar of Winwick, and Robert Loxham, vicar of Poulton,
held between them three-quarters of the manor in 1729, and
William Elletson, of Parrox Hall, had possession of the other
fourth, which is now the hereditary estate of Daniel Hope
Elletson, esq., justice of the peace, residing at the same seat.
At the end of the last century the Hornbys disposed of their
share to John Bourne, gentleman, of Stalmine, from whom it
descended to his second son, James Bourne, of Stalmine, and
from him to his nephews, Thomas, James, and Peter, successively.
The other portion of the manorial rights of the three-fourths was
subsequently acquired by the last-surviving nephew, Peter Bourne,
of Heathfield and Liverpool. Peter Bourne, esq., of Hackensall,
married Margaret, the only daughter of James Drinkwater, esq.,
of Bent, in Lancashire, and left issue James, who is the present
lord of three-quarters of the manor, and owner of the ancient Hall.
James Bourne, esq., M.P., of Hackensall, and of Heathfield, near<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
Liverpool, is Col.-Comdt. of the Royal Lancashire regiment of
Militia Artillery, a deputy-lieutenant, and a justice of the peace of
this county. Colonel Bourne has recently restored the old manor
house, but in such a way as to preserve, and not obliterate, its
links with a bygone age. The antique fire-places, one of which
was protected by a massive arch of stone sweeping across the
whole width of the room, have been renewed as before, and
although the main doorway has been removed to another part of
the building, the stone with the initials F. R. A., being those of
Richard Fleetwood and Anne, his wife, has been reinstated in its
original position above the newly-constructed lintel. Rumour
affirms that during certain alterations two or three skeletons,
supposed to be those of females, were found bricked up in a
narrow chamber in one of the walls, and whilst confirming the
discovery of a long secret recess, we dare not venture, for the
evidence is somewhat contradictory, to hold ourselves responsible
for the strict accuracy of the other part of the story, which
suggests the enactment of a scene of revolting cruelty, similar
to that introduced by Sir Walter Scott in the following lines:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Yet well the luckless wretch might shriek,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Well might her paleness terror speak!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For there was seen in that dark wall,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Two niches, narrow, deep, and tall.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who enters at such grisly door</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shall ne’er I wean find exit more.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In each a slender meal was laid</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of roots, of water, and of bread.</div>
    <div class="verse indent14">...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hewn stones and mortar were display’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And building tools in order laid.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The moat has now been nearly filled up, but its extent and
direction can still be pointed out. There are no indications of a
chapel having formerly constituted part of the residential building,
but several years since, when an outhouse was destroyed, at a
short distance, about twenty yards, two gravestones were discovered,
and it is probable that they were somewhere near, if not
actually on the site of, the private chapel or oratory. One of the
stones was broken up immediately, and the other is practically
illegible, although three or four words, still preserved, prove that
the inscription has not been in raised characters. The rights to
wreckage, etc. on the foreshore of the manor have pertained to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
the lords of Hackensall from time immemorial, and still continue
to be held and exercised as portion of the lordship.</p>

<p>Anterior to the establishment of a port at Fleetwood, or more
correctly speaking, to the foundation of a town and the erection
of wharfage, etc., on the warren forming the western boundary of
Wyre estuary, Wardleys and Skippool, almost facing each other,
were the harbours to which all commercial traffic on the river
was directed. Ships of considerable size, freighted with cargoes
of various sorts, found their way to those secluded havens, and
even within the last few years, during high tides, vessels laden
with grain have been berthed and unloaded in the narrow creek
leading from Skippool bay, while bags of guano have often terminated
their sea-voyages at Wardleys. A solitary warehouse,
however, undated, but bearing on its battered exterior and decaying
timbers the unmistakable stamp of time, is, at the present
day, almost the only remaining witness to the former pretentions
of the first named place. At Wardleys, three or four spacious
warehouses, in a similarly dilapidated condition and now partially
converted into shippons, the remainder being unused except as
lumber-rooms or temporary storehouses for guano or some local
agricultural produce, together with a stone wharf, are evidences
of a fair amount of business having once been carried on at that
little port.</p>

<p>In 1825 Baines described Wardleys as “a small seaport on the
river Wyre, where vessels of 300 tons register may discharge their
burdens, situated in the township of Stalmine with Stainall, in
the hundred of Amounderness;” but in the year 1708 customs
were established at Poulton in connection with Wardleys and
Skippool. Nor should we be justified in limiting the antiquity of
the ports to that date, for as early as 1590-1600, William and
James Blackburne, of Thistleton, carried on an extensive trade
with Russia, and there can be no doubt that their cargoes of merchandise,
most likely flax and tallow, were landed on the banks
of the Wyre at those ancient harbours. The father of the above
merchants was the first of the family to take up his residence in
this neighbourhood, and appears to have settled at Garstang,
about 1550, from Yorkshire. That the commercial dealings of
the partners were both large and successful is shown in the property
acquired by William Blackburne, the elder brother, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
purchased Newton, lands in Thistleton, and several other estates
of considerable magnitude in the Fylde, all of which he bequeathed
to his son and heir, Richard. Richard Blackburne married Jane,
the daughter of John Aynesworth, of Newton, and had issue John
of Eccleston; Richard, of Goosnargh; Thomas, of Orford and
Newton; Edward, of Stockenbridge, near St. Michael’s-on-Wyre;
Robert, who was suspected of being implicated in the Gunpowder
Plot, but acquitted, the evidence being insufficient; Annie, who
married—Nickson; and Elizabeth, the wife of William Standish.
When the Singletons of Staining became extinct, the Hall and
estate of that name passed to a William Blackburne, as heir-at-law,
and there is great probability that he was a descendant of one
of the sons of Richard Blackburne of Thistleton, Newton, etc.—most
likely of John Blackburn, of Eccleston.</p>

<p>During the years more immediately previous to the opening of
the new port at the mouth of the river, a great many large ships
from America, laden with timber, and brigs from Russia, with flax
and tallow, were discharged at Wardleys. A three masted vessel,
for the foreign trade, was also constructed in the ship-yard
attached to that place, but as far as can be learnt this was the
only vessel of equal dimensions ever built there, repairs being the
chief occupation of the workpeople.</p>

<p>Several of the officers connected with the Custom House at
Poulton, were stationed at Knot End, opposite the Warren,
living in the small cottage standing near the shore, in order to
board the different craft as they entered the river, and pilot them
up the stream to Wardleys. A large hotel is situated behind
the site of the old ship-yard, and during the summer months is
generally well patronised by visitors, to whom, as well as to the
pleasure-parties arriving by water from Fleetwood, and by road
from Blackpool, the hamlet is now mainly indebted for support.
Some large mussels, the “Mytili angulosi,” but known amongst
the natives of those parts as “Hambleton hookings,” were found
formerly in large quantities a little lower down the river, but lately
specimens of this fine shell-fish have been growing much scarcer.
Dr. Leigh, in his Natural History of our county, informs us that
pearls have frequently been discovered enclosed within the shells
of these molluscs, and also that their popular name arises from the
manner in which they are taken, the feat being accomplished “by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
plucking them from their Skeers, or Beds, with Hooks.” The
tidal estuary of the Wyre embraces an area of three miles by two,
and it is near to its termination that the port and town of Fleetwood
are situated. Our purpose now is not to enter into a
description of the harbour, which will be found in the chapter
specially devoted to the seaport itself, but a few words as to the
advantages derived from the nature of the river’s current and its
bed, will not be out of place. Captain Denham, R.N., F.R.S.,
after inspecting the site of the proposed port on behalf of the promoters,
issued a report in the month of January, 1840, and
amongst other things, stated that during the first half of the ebb-tide,
a reflux of backwater was produced which dipped with such
a powerful under-scour as to preserve a natural basin, capable of
riding ships of eighteen or twenty feet draught, at low water,
spring tides; also that the anchorage ground, both within and
without the harbour, was excellent. These facts alone seemed
sufficient to warrant the gallant officer’s prediction that the
undertaking would be successful and remunerative, but when in
addition it is called to mind, that “as easy and safe as Wyre
water” had for long been a proverb amongst the mariners of our
coast, and that the harbour was, and is, perfectly sheltered from
all winds, as well as connected with a railway terminus which
communicates with Preston, Manchester, etc., we are astonished
that comparatively so little encouragement has been given to it,
and that now, thirty-five years from the date of this survey, the
first dock is only approaching completion.</p>

<p>The river Wyre is plentifully supplied with fish of various sorts;
in the higher parts of the stream trout and smelts may be found,
whilst the lower portion and estuary contain codling, flounders,
sea-perch, conger, sand eels, and occasionally salmon. The
earliest enactments with regard to the fisheries connected with
the last-named fish related to the Wyre, Ribble, and other rivers
of Lancashire. In 1389, during the reign of Richard II., a law,
which arranged the times and seasons when the fisheries in these
rivers should be closed, and other matters affecting them, was
passed and brought into force, being the first regulation of its
kind.</p>

<p>The Ribble is associated with the Fylde only in so much as its
tidal estuary is concerned, which forms the southern boundary of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
the district. Since 1837 great alterations have been effected in
the channel of the river by the Ribble Navigation Improvement
Company. The stream for the larger portion of its extent from
Preston to the Naze Point has been confined within stone
embankments, and its bed considerably deepened by dredging.
During the progress of these improvements wide tracts of land
have been reclaimed both north and south of the current.
From Freckleton the river rapidly widens as it approaches
the sea, so that a direct line drawn from Lytham to Southport
across its mouth would pass over a distance of seven or
eight miles. The channel here is shallow, while the sands on
each side are flat and extensive, and midway in the estuary, at its
lowest part, lies the far-famed Horse-bank, which divides the
stream into a north and south current, scarcely discernible,
however, after the tide has risen above the level of the bank.
About one mile from the town of Lytham, in the direction of
Preston, is a pool of moderate dimensions, having an open communication
with the river, and formed into a small harbour or
dock for yachts and vessels connected with the coasting trade.
In the bed of the river, a little higher up than that locality,
trunks of large trees are occasionally observed at low water, and
many such remains of a once noble forest, which is believed to
have extended from near the Welsh coast as far even as Morecambe,
have been raised at different times during the operation of
dredging.</p>

<p>The following descriptions of the Ribble, its source, course, and
tributaries, were written, respectively, by the ancient topographer
Harrison, and the poet Drayton, whose accounts of the Wyre
have been previously quoted:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Rybell, a river verie rich of Salmon and Lampreie, dooth in manner
inviron Preston in Andernesse, and it riseth neere to Ribbesdale above Gisburne.
It goeth from thence to Sawley or Salley, Chatburne, Woodington, Clitherow
Castell, and beneath Mitton meeteth with the Odder, which ryseth not farre from
the Cross of Grete in Yorkshire, and going thence to Shilburne, Newton,
Radholme parke, and Stony hirst, it falleth ere long into Ribble water. From
thence the Ribble hath not gone farre, but it meeteth with the Calder. Thys
brooke ryseth above Holme Church, goeth by Townley and Burneley (where
it receiveth a trifeling rill), thence to Higham, and ere long crossing one
water that cometh from Wicoler, by Colne, and another by and by named Pidle
brooke that runneth by Newechurch, in the Pidle: it meeteth with ye Calder,
which passeth forth to Padiam, and thence (receyving a becke on the other side)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
it runneth on to Altham, and so to Martholme, where the Henburne brooke doth
joyn with all, that goeth by Alkington chappell, Dunkinhalge, Rishton, and so
into ye Calder as I have sayde before. The Calder therefore being thus inlarged,
runneth forth to Reade (where M. Noell dwelleth), to Whalley, and soon after
into Ribell, that goeth from this confluence to Salisbury hall, Ribchester, Osbaston,
Sambury, Keuerden, Law, Ribles bridge, and then taketh in the Darwent, before
it goeth by Pontwarth or Pentworth into the sea. The Darwent devideth Leland
shire from Andernesse,<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> and it ryseth by east above Darwent Chappell, and soone
after uniting it selfe with the Blackeburne, and Rodlesworthe water it goeth
thorowe Howghton Parke, by Howghton towne, to Walton hall, and so into the
Ribell. As for the Sannocke brooke, it ryseth somewhat above Longridge
Chappell, goeth to Broughton towne, Cotham, Lee hall, and so into Ribell.”</p>

<p>The beautiful scenery and historical associations of the Ribble
render it the most interesting and charming of the several rivers
which water the county of Lancaster. The quietude of its fair
valley has on more than one occasion been rudely broken by the
clash of arms, and students of our country’s history will readily<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
call to mind that calamitous day to the Duke of Hamilton, when
Cromwell routed the Highlanders under his command, near
Preston,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“And Darwen stream with blood of Scots imbrued.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Other instances of war-like doings along the banks of this river
might be recounted, but as the neighbourhoods in which they
occurred are not enclosed within the Fylde boundaries, we are
perforce obliged to exclude them from this volume, and must
refer those of our readers who are anxious to learn more both of
them and of the river itself to other sources for the required
information. The chief fish of the Ribble is of course its salmon,
but in addition the estuary contains numbers of flounders and
other varieties of the finny tribes similar to those found in the
tidal portion of the Wyre. During the sixteenth century
sturgeons seem to have been captured occasionally in the Ribble,
and amongst the records of the duchy in 1536, there is a complaint
that when “one certain sturgeon was found within the
township of Warton and seized for the use of the King (who held
the right of fishery there), and laid up in a house in Warton, one
Christopher Bone, of Warton, and James Bradʳton, of the ley,
with divers riotous persons, about the 6th of May last, did then
and there take out of the said house the said sturgeon, and the
said Bone hath at divers times and in like manner taken
sturgeons and porpoises to his own use and the injury of his
majesty.”<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>As such a small part, and that far from the most important, of
Ribble stream is really connected with the Fylde, and as it is
not our intention to trespass beyond the limits of that district,—at
least not knowingly, and the margin in the present instance is so
clearly defined that no excuse could be offered for overstepping it,—we
are compelled to content ourselves with this brief account,
leaving much unsaid that is of considerable historical and general
interest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Sea</span> which washes over the westerly shore of the Fylde
forms part of St. George’s Channel or the Irish Sea, whilst the
narrow northern boundary of the same district is limited by the
waters of Morecambe Bay. The main peculiarities to be noticed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
along the extensive line of this coast swept over by the billows of
the Irish Sea, are the almost entire absence of seaweeds and the
levelness of the sands; indeed, so gentle is the slope of the latter
that its average declivity has been estimated at no more than one
foot in every fifty yards, and to the flatness of this surface it is
due that the beach is in a very great measure freed from putrifying
heaps of fish and seaweed, for the rising tides glide with such
swiftness over the level sandy beds that most driftmatters and
impurities are left behind in the depths beyond low water mark.
An analysis, made by Dr. Schweitzer, of the waters of the English
coast, furnishes the following result:—</p>

<p>There are few, we imagine, who have not at one time or
another admired the luminous appearance of the sea on certain
evenings. This astonishing and beautiful phenomenon is brought
about by the presence in the water of myriads of tiny beings,
called Noctilucæ, which possess the power of emitting a phosphorescent
light, and seemingly convert the bursting waves into
masses of liquid fire. The immense expanse of sea spreading out
from the westerly border of the Fylde has, independently of its
association with the Gulph Stream, a marked influence in
equalising the climate and averting those sudden and extreme
degrees of heat and cold commonly experienced inland. The
atmosphere over water does not undergo such rapid alterations in
its temperature as that over land, and hence it happens that
localities situated near the coast are cooler in summer and
warmer in winter than others far removed from its vicinity.
Most people will have observed that after a calm sunny day at
the seaside, a breeze from the land invariably arises after sunset,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
due to the fact that the air over the earth being cooled and
condensed much sooner than that over the sea, the heavier body
of atmosphere endeavours to displace the warmer and lighter one.
A gentle evaporation is daily taking place from the surface of the
sea, by which the air becomes loaded with moisture, remaining
suspended until the coolness of evening sets in, when it is
deposited on the ground as dew. The water thus obtained from
the deep is not pure brine, as might at first sight appear, but is
freed from its salts by the process of natural distillation which
has been undergone. Similar evaporation also goes on from the
surfaces of the Ribble and Wyre, and it is doubtless chiefly owing
to the Fylde being almost environed by water, constantly disseminating
dew, that its fecundity is not only so great, but also so
constant. The following is a list of the seaweeds to be found on
the coast:—</p>

<h3>ALLEN OF ROSSALL HALL.</h3>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">The Allens who resided at Rossall Hall for a period
of more than half a century, and by intermarriage
became connected with the Westbys of Mowbreck,
the Heskeths of Mains, and the Gillows of Bryning,
sprang from the county of Stafford. At the time of the
Protestant Reformation, George Allen, of Brookhouse, in
the division just mentioned, held a long lease of the Grange
and Hall of Rossall from a kinsman of his family, one of the
abbots of Deulacres, a Staffordshire monastery, to which the
estate had been granted by King John. George Allen at his
death left one son, John, who resided at the Hall, and subsequently
married Jane, the sister of Thomas Lister, of Arnold
Biggin, in Yorkshire. The offspring of this marriage were
Richard, William, Gabriel, George, who espoused Elizabeth,
the daughter of William Westby, of Mowbreck; Mary, afterwards
the wife of Thomas Worthington, of Blainscow; Elizabeth,
subsequently the wife of William Hesketh, of Mains Hall; and
Anne, who married George Gillow, of Bryning. Richard Allen,
of Rossall Hall, the eldest son, left at his demise a widow with
three daughters, named respectively, Helen, Catherine, and Mary,
who were deprived of their possessions and rights in the Grange
in the year 1583 by Edmund Fleetwood, whose father had
purchased the reversion of the lease from Henry VIII., at the
time when the larger monastic institutions were dissolved in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
England. The widow and her daughters fled to Rheims to escape
further persecution, where they were hospitably received by their
near relative, Cardinal William Allen, who interested the princely
family of Guise in their behalf and so obtained for them the means
of subsistence.</p>

<p>William Allen, the second son of John Allen, of Rossall Hall,
was born in 1532, and at the early age of fifteen entered Oriel
College, Oxford, under the tutorship of Morgan Philips, perhaps
the most eminent logician of his day. Three years later he was
elected to a fellowship. Upon the accession of Mary he entered
the church, and in 1556 was made principal of St. Mary’s Hall,
acting as Proctor for the two succeeding years. In 1558 he was
created canon of York, but on the accession of Elizabeth, he
refused the Protestant oaths, was deprived of his fellowship, and,
in 1560, retired to Louvaine, where he wrote his first work,
entitled “A Defence of the Doctrine of Catholics, concerning
Purgatory and Prayers for the Dead,” in answer to an attack on
those dogmas by Bishop Jewell. In 1565, the year in which this
publication appeared and fermented great excitement both here
and abroad, William Allen determined, in spite of the extreme
dangers of such an act, to visit his native country, more
especially the home of his fathers at Rossall. Religious zeal
prevented his active spirit from being long at rest; after residing
in England about three years and visiting different parts of
Lancashire, seeking converts to his creed, he was obliged to
secrete himself from the eye of the law amongst his friends,
Layton Hall and Mains Hall being two of his hiding places,
until a suitable opportunity occurred for escaping over to the
continent. Flanders was his destination, and from there he went
to Mechlin, afterwards taking up his abode at Douai, where he
obtained a doctor’s degree, and established an English seminary.
This college, we learn from the “Mem: Miss: Priests: Ed. 1741,”
was founded in 1568 “to train up English scholars in virtue and
learning, and to qualify them to labour in the vineyard of the
Lord, on their return to their native country; it was the first
college in the Christian world, instituted according to the model
given by the council of Trent.”</p>

<p>Whilst engaged at the above scholastic institution, William
Allen was appointed canon of Cambray; subsequently when the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
English council applied to the ruling powers of the Spanish
Netherlands to suppress the college of Douai, the Doctor and his
assistants were received under the protection of the house
of Guise. Afterwards Doctor Allen, on being appointed canon of
Rheims, established another seminary in that city. At that time
perhaps no one was more admired and revered by the Catholic
party abroad, and detested by the Protestant subjects of England,
than William Allen. He was even accused by his countrymen at
home of having traitorously instigated Philip II. of Spain, to
attempt the invasion and conquest of England, and although he
strenuously denied any agency in that matter, it is certain that
after the defeat of the Armada, he wrote a defence of Sir William
Stanley and Sir Rowland York, who had assisted the enemy. In
1587, he was made cardinal of St. Martin in Montibus by Pope
Sectus V., and a little later was presented by the king of Spain
to a rich abbey in Naples with promises of still higher preferment.
In 1588 he published the “Declaration of the Sentence of Sixtus
the Fifth,” which was directed against the government of the
British queen, whom he declared an usurper, obstinate and
impenitent, and for these reasons to be deprived. As an appendix
to the work he issued shortly afterwards an “Admonition to the
Nobility and People of England and Ireland,” in which he pronounced
the queen an illegitimate daughter of Henry VIII.
Although the effect of these publications on the English nation
was not, as he hoped, to arouse the people to open rebellion, or
in any way to advance the Catholic cause, the efforts of the
cardinal were so far appreciated by the king of Spain that he
promoted him to the archbishopric of Mechlin. He lived at
Rome during the remainder of his life in great luxury and
magnificence. On October 6th, 1594, this remarkable man
expired at his palace, in the 63rd year of his age, and was
buried with great pomp at the English church of the Holy
Trinity in the ancient imperial city.</p>

<h3>BUTLER OF RAWCLIFFE HALL.</h3>

<p>The name of Butler, or as it was formerly written Botiler,
belonged to an office in existence in earlier times, and was first
assumed by Theobald Walter, who married Maud, the sister of
Thomas à Becket, on being appointed <i>Butler</i> of Ireland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span></p>

<p>Theobald Walter-Botiler gave to his relative Richard Pincerna,
or Botiler, as the family was afterwards called, the whole of Out
Rawcliffe and one carucate of land in Staynole. This gentleman
was the founder of that branch of the Butlers which was established
at Rawcliffe Hall for so many generations. Sir Richard
Botiler, of Rawcliffe, married Alicia, in 1281, the daughter of
William de Carleton, and thus obtained the manor of Inskip.
He had issue—William, Henry, Richard, Edmund, and Galfrid.
Richard Botiler, the third son, who had some possessions in
Marton, left at his death one son, also named Richard, who was
living in 1323, and became the progenitor of the Butlers of
Kirkland. William, the eldest son, espoused Johanna de Sifewast,
a widow, by whom he had Nicholas de Botiler, who was alive in
1322, and had issue by his wife Olivia, one son, William Botiler,
living in 1390. William Botiler had three children—John,
Richard, and Eleanor. John Botiler was created a knight, and in
1393-4-5 was High Sheriff of the county of Lancaster. Sir John
Botiler left at his death, in 1404, three sons and one daughter, the
offspring of his marriage with Isabella, his second wife, who was
the widow of Sir John Butler, of Bewsey. Nicholas, the eldest
son, was also twice married, and had issue by his first wife,
Margeria, the daughter of Sir Richard Kirkeby,—John and
Isabella Botiler. John Botiler espoused, in 1448, Elizabeth, the
daughter of William Botiler, of Warrington, and had issue—Nicholas
and Elizabeth Botiler. Nicholas Botiler married Alice,
the daughter of Sir Thomas Radcliffe, knt., and was succeeded
by his eldest son John Botiler, who subsequently espoused
Elizabeth, the daughter and heiress of Sir John Lawrence, knt.,
and had issue—William, James, Richard, and Robert Botiler.
James Botiler, the second son, inherited the estates, most
probably owing to the death of William, his elder brother, and
married Elizabeth, the daughter of Sir Thomas Molyneux, knt., of
Larbrick Hall. James Botiler, or Butler, was living in 1500, but
died shortly afterwards, leaving two sons and two daughters—John,
Nicholas, Isabella, and Elizabeth. John, the elder son, had
issue four daughters, whilst Nicholas, the second son, had issue
by his first wife, the daughter of Richard Bold, of Bold, two sons,
Richard and Henry, and by his second wife, Isabel, the daughter
and co-heiress of John Clayton, of Clayton, one daughter, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
died in 1606. Richard Butler married Agnes, the daughter of
Sir Richard Houghton, knt., but having no offspring, the estates
of Rawcliffe passed to William Butler, the eldest son of his
younger brother, Henry Butler, somewhere about 1627. William
Butler espoused Elizabeth, the daughter of Cuthbert Clifton, of
Westby, by whom he had one son, Henry, who was thrice
married, and had numerous offspring. Richard, the eldest son
of Henry Butler by his first wife, Dorothy, the daughter of Henry
Stanley, of Bickerstaffe, died before his father, but left several
sons, one of whom, also named Richard, succeeded to the
Rawcliffe property, and was thirty-two years of age in 1664;
another, Nicholas, was a colonel in the time of Charles I.; and
another, John, was a citizen of London. Richard Butler espoused
Katherine, the daughter of Thomas Carus, of Halton, by whom
he had a large family, the eldest of which, Henry, was six years of
age in 1664. Henry Butler, of Rawcliffe, espoused as his first
wife, Katherine, the granddaughter, and subsequently heiress, of
Sir John Girlington, knt., of Thurland Castle, and had issue—Richard,
Christopher, Philip, Mary, and Katherine. Henry
Butler, and Richard, his eldest son, took part with the Pretender
in the rebellion of 1715, and for this piece of disaffection their
estates were confiscated by the crown, and afterwards sold. Henry
Butler made his escape over to France, but Richard was seized,
tried, and condemned to death. He died in prison, however, in
1716, before the time appointed for his sentence to be carried out,
leaving an only child, Catherine, by his wife, Mary, the daughter
of Henry Curwen, of Workington, who married Edward Markham,
of Ollarton, in the county of Nottingham, and died a minor
without issue. Henry Butler lived in the Isle of Man for several
years, and espoused Elizabeth Butler, of Kirkland, his third wife,
but had no further issue.</p>

<h3>CLIFTON OF CLIFTON, WESTBY, AND LYTHAM.</h3>

<p>The family of the Cliftons, whose present seat is Lytham Hall,
has been associated with the Fylde for many centuries. The
earliest ancestor of whom there exists any authentic record, was
Sir William de Clyfton, who lived in the time of William II.,
surnamed Rufus, and during the last year of that monarch’s
reign, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1100, gave certain lands in Salwick to his son William<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
upon his marriage. In 1258 a namesake and descendant of this
William de Clyfton held ten carucates of land in Amounderness,
and was a collector of aids for the county of Lancaster. His son
Gilbert de Clyfton was lord of the manors of Clifton, Westby,
Fylde-Plumpton, etc., and High Sheriff of the county in the
years 1278, 1287, and 1289. He died in 1324, during the reign
of Edward II., and was succeeded by his eldest son, Sir William
de Clifton, who was Knight of the Shire for Lancaster 1302-1304.
Sir William de Clifton,<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> knt., the son of the latter gentleman,
came into possession of the estates on the demise of his father,
and married in 1329, Margaret, the daughter of Sir R. Shireburne,
knt., of Stonyhurst, by whom he had issue one son, Nicholas,
afterwards knighted. He also entailed the manors of Clifton and
Westby on his male issue, and settled the manor of Goosnargh
upon his son and heir. He died in 1365. Sir Nicholas de
Clifton, during one portion of his life, held the post of Governor
of the Castle of Ham, in Picardy. He married Margaret, the
daughter of Sir Thomas West, of Snitterfield, in Warwickshire,
and had issue two sons—Robert and Thomas. The former, who
succeeded him, was Knight of the Shire 1382-1383, and espoused
Eleyne, the daughter of Sir Robert Ursewyck, knt., by whom he
had three sons—Thomas, Roger, and James. In course of time,
Thomas, the eldest, became the representative of the family, and
married Agnes, the daughter of Sir Richard Molyneux, of Sefton.
This gentleman (Thomas Clifton), accompanied the army of
Henry V., when that monarch invaded France in 1415. He
settled Goosnargh and Wood-Plumpton upon his second son,
James, while the other portion of the estates passed, on his death
in 1442, to Richard, his heir. Richard Clifton formed a matrimonial
alliance with Alice, the daughter of John Butler, of
Rawcliffe, from which sprang one child, James Clifton, who
afterwards espoused Alice, the daughter of Robert Lawrence, of
Ashton. The offspring of the latter union were Robert and John
Clifton. The former on inheriting the property married Margaret,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
the daughter of Nicholas Butler, of Bewsey, in Lancashire. His
children were Cuthbert and William; and now, for a few generations,
we have two separate branches, the descendants of these
gentlemen, which afterwards became united in the persons of
their respective representatives:—</p>

</div>

<p>This Thomas Clifton retained the Fairsnape estates, which he
had inherited from his mother, during his lifetime, but on his
decease they passed to his uncle. He married Eleanora Alathea,
the daughter of Richard Walmsley, of Dunkenhalgh, in Lancashire.
At his death he left a family of five daughters and two
sons, the eldest of whom, Thomas Clifton, of Clifton, Westby,
and Lytham, subsequently espoused Mary, the daughter of the
fifth Viscount Molyneux. His heir, also Thomas, and born in
1728, rebuilt Lytham Hall, and allied himself to the noble house
of Abingdon by marrying, as his third wife, Lady Jane Bertie,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
the daughter of the third earl. The children of this union were
seven, and John, the eldest, born in 1764, inherited the estates,
and married Elizabeth, the daughter of Thomas Horsley Widdrington-Riddell,
of Felton Park, Northumberland. John Clifton
was succeeded by his eldest son, Thomas, who had four brothers
and three sisters—John, William, Charles, Mary, Harriet, and
Elizabeth. Thomas Clifton, of Clifton and Lytham, born in 1788,
was a justice of the peace, a deputy-lieutenant, and in 1835,
High Sheriff of the county of Lancaster. He married Hetty,
the daughter of Pellegrine Trevis, an Italian gentleman of ancient
lineage, by whom he had issue John Talbot, born in 1819;
Thomas Henry, lieut.-colonel in the army, and knight of the
Legion of Honour and of the Mejidie; Edward Arthur, died
abroad in 1850; Charles Frederick, who espoused Lady Edith
Maud, eldest daughter of the second Marquis of Hastings, and
assumed in 1859, by act of parliament, the arms and surname of
Abney Hasting; and Augustus Wykenham, late captain in the
Rifle Brigade, who married Lady Bertha Lelgarde Hastings,
second daughter of the second Marquis of Hastings. John Talbot
Clifton, esq., is still living, and is the present lord of Lytham,
Clifton, etc. He was for some years colonel of the 1st. Royal
Lancashire Militia, and sat in Parliament from 1844 to 1847 as
Member for North Lancashire. In 1844 he married Eleanor
Cicily, the daughter of the Hon. Colonel Lowther, M.P., and has
one son, Thomas Henry Clifton, esq., who was born in 1845, and
is now one of the Members of Parliament for North Lancashire.
John Talbot Clifton, esq., is a justice of the peace, and deputy-lieutenant
of this county. Thomas Henry Clifton, esq., M.P.,
espoused, in 1867, Madeline Diana Elizabeth, the eldest daughter
of Sir Andrew Agnew, bart., and has issue several children.</p>

<p>In 1872 Henry Lowther succeeded his uncle as third earl of
Lonsdale, and at the same time his sisters Eleanor Cicily, the wife
of John Talbot Clifton, esq., of Lytham Hall, and Augusta Mary,
the wife of the Right Hon. Gerard James Noel, M.P., younger
son of the first earl of Gainsborough, were elevated to the rank of
earl’s daughters.</p>

<h3>FLEETWOOD OF ROSSALL HALL.</h3>

<p>This family sprang originally from Little Plumpton in the
Fylde. Henry Fleetwood being the first of whom there is any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
reliable record, and of him nothing is known beyond the place of
his residence, and the fact that he had a son named Edmund.
Edmund Fleetwood married Elizabeth Holland, of Downholme,
and was living about the middle and earlier portion of the latter
half of the fifteenth century. From that marriage there sprang
one son, William Fleetwood, who subsequently espoused Ellyn,
the daughter of Robert Standish, and had issue John, Thomas,
and Robert Fleetwood. Of these three sons, Thomas, the second,
resided at Vach in the county of Buckingham, and at the
dissolution of the monasteries by Henry VIII., about 1536,
purchased from that monarch the reversion of the lease of
Rossall Grange, then held by the Allens from the Abbot and
convent of Deulacres, in Staffordshire. Thomas Fleetwood
married Barbara, the cousin and heiress of Andrew Frances, of
London, and had issue five sons, the second and third of whom
were knighted later in life, whilst the eldest, Edmund, came into
possession of Rossall Hall and estate in 1583, after the demise of
Richard Allen, whose widow and daughters were ejected. Thus
Edmund Fleetwood was the first of the name to reside at Rossall,
where he died about forty years later. This gentleman married
Elizabeth, the daughter of John Cheney, of Chesham Boys, in
Buckinghamshire, and had issue several sons and daughters.
Paul, the eldest son and heir, who succeeded him, was knighted
by either James I. or Charles I., and married Jane, the daughter
of Richard Argall from the county of Kent, by whom he had
three sons and two daughters. Edmund, the eldest son, had no
male issue, and at his death, in 1644, Richard, his brother,
succeeded to the property and resided at Rossall Hall. Richard
Fleetwood, who was only fifteen years of age when the death of
his predecessor occurred, subsequently espoused a lady, named
Anne Mayo, from the county of Herts, by whom he had only
two children, a son and a daughter, and as the former died in
youth, the estate passed to the next male heir on his demise.
The heir was found in the person of Francis, of Hackensall Hall,
the brother of Richard Fleetwood and the third son of Sir Paul
Fleetwood. Francis Fleetwood, of Rossall, married Mary, the
daughter of C. Foster, of Preesall, and had issue Richard
Fleetwood, who succeeded him, and a daughter. Richard
Fleetwood resided at Rossall Hall, and married Margaret, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
daughter of Edwin Fleetwood, of Leyland, in 1674. The
offspring of that union were two sons, Edward and Paul, and a
daughter Margaret. Edward, the heir, was born in 1682, and
practised for some time as an attorney in Ireland. On the death
of his father, however, he inherited the property, and took up his
abode at the ancestral Hall. He espoused Sarah, the daughter of
Edward Veale, of Whinney Heys. Thomas Tyldesley, of Fox
Hall, Blackpool, was on terms of friendship and intimacy with
the Fleetwoods of Rossall at that period, and on the fourteenth of
April, 1714, the following entry occurs in his diary, referring to
Edward Fleetwood, the lord of the manor, and his brother Paul,
also Edward Veale, the father of Mrs. Ed. Fleetwood, whom, for
some reason unknown, the diarist invariably designated Captain
Veale:—“Went to Rosshall. Dinᵈ with the trustys, yᵉ Lord
&amp; his lady, Mr. Paull, and Capᵗᵗ Veal. Gave I. Gardiner 1s., and
a boy 6d.; soe to ffox Hall.”</p>

<p>Paul Fleetwood, the younger brother of the “Lord” died in
1727 and was buried at Kirkham, where some of his descendants
still exist in very humble circumstances.</p>

<p>The offspring of Edward Fleetwood consisted only of one child,
a daughter, named Margaret, who was born in 1715, and to
whom the estates appear to have descended on the decease of her
father. On the sixteenth of February, 1733, she married, at
Bispham church, Roger Hesketh, of North Meols and Tulketh.
Roger Hesketh and his lady resided at Rossall Hall until their
respective demises, which happened, the latter in 1752, and the
former in 1791. Fleetwood and Sarah Hesketh were the children
of their union. On the decease of his father at the ripe age of
81 years, the son and heir, Fleetwood, had already been dead 22
years, and consequently his son, Bold Fleetwood Hesketh, the
eldest offspring of his marriage, in 1759, with Frances, the third
daughter of Peter Bold, of Bold Hall, in the county of Lancaster,
succeeded his grandfather Roger Hesketh. Bold Fleetwood
Hesketh, who was born in 1762, died unmarried in 1819, and
was buried at Poulton, his younger brother, Robert Hesketh,
inheriting the Hall and estates. Robert Hesketh was in his 55th
year when he became possessed of the property, and had already
been married 29 years to Maria, the daughter of Henry Rawlinson,
of Lancaster, by whom he had a numerous family. His four<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
eldest sons died in youth and unmarried, the oldest having only
attained the age of twenty three, so that at his decease in 1824 he
was succeeded by his fifth son, Peter Hesketh. This gentleman,
who was born in 1801, espoused at Dover, in 1826, Eliza
Delamaire, the daughter of Sir Theophilus J. Metcalf, of Fern
Hill, Berkshire, by whom he had several children, who died in
early youth. As his second wife he married, in 1837, Verginie
Marie, the daughter of Senor Pedro Garcia, and had issue one
son, Peter Louis Hesketh. In 1831, Peter Hesketh obtained
power by royal license to adopt the surname of Fleetwood in
addition to his own, and in 1838 he was created a baronet. In
1844, Sir Peter Hesketh Fleetwood vacated Rossall Hall, and the
site is now occupied by a large public educational institution,
denominated the Northern Church of England School. Sir
P. H. Fleetwood died, at Brighton, in 1866, leaving one son and
heir, the Rev. Sir Peter Louis Hesketh Fleetwood, bart., M.A., of
Sunbury on Thames, in the county of Middlesex. The Rev.
Charles Hesketh, M.A., rector of North Meols, is the younger
brother of the late Sir P. H. Fleetwood, and consequently uncle
to the present baronet.</p>

<h3>FFRANCE OF LITTLE ECCLESTON HALL.</h3>

<p>William, the son of John ffrance, who married the younger
daughter of Richard Kerston, of Little Eccleston, was the first of
this family to reside at the Hall, and he was living there at the
beginning of the seventeenth century. William ffrance had two
sons and a daughter—John, born 1647; Henry, born 1649; and
Alice, born 1653. John, the eldest son, succeeded to the Hall
and estates on the demise of his father, and married Deborah
Elston, of Brockholes, by whom he had issue—Robert, who died
in 1671; Anne, died 1672; Thomas, died 1672; Deborah, died
1673; John, born 1675; William, died 1680; Henry, died 1676;
Mary, died 1701; and Edward, died 1703. John ffrance, senʳ.,
survived all his sons except John and Edward, and on his
death, in 1690, was succeeded by the former and elder of the two
brothers. John ffrance, like his father, resided at the Hall, and
espoused Joan, daughter of John Cross, of Cross Hall, by whom
he had issue—John, born 1699; Anne, died 1702; and Henry,
died 1707. John ffrance died in 1762, and his eldest son, John,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
inherited the estates. This John ffrance married Elizabeth,
daughter and heiress of Thomas Roe, of Out Rawcliffe, and by
that union became possessed, later, of Rawcliffe manor and Hall,
to which the family of ffrance removed. John ffrance, of
Rawcliffe Hall, the son and heir of John and Elizabeth ffrance,
of Little Eccleston Hall, and subsequently of Rawcliffe, died
childless in 1817, aged 91 years, and bequeathed his property to
Thomas Wilson, of Preston, who assumed the name of ffrance.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<h3>HESKETH OF MAINS HALL.</h3>

<p>This family was descended from the Heskeths, of Rufford,
through William Hesketh, of Aughton, the sixth son of Thomas
Hesketh, of Rufford. Bartholomew, the son of William
Hesketh, of Aughton, succeeded to his father’s estates, and
married Mary, the daughter of William Norris, of Speke, by
whom he had one son, George, residing at Little Poulton Hall in
1570. George Hesketh married Dorothy, the daughter of William
Westby, of Mowbreck, and had issue a son, William, who, on his
father’s death, somewhere about 1571, inherited considerable
property, comprising possessions in no less than twenty-eight
different townships in Lancashire. William Hesketh, who was
living in 1613, married Elizabeth, the daughter of John Allen, of
Rossall Hall, and sister to Cardinal Allen. The children springing
from that union were William and Wilfrid. William, the elder
son, is the first of the Heskeths mentioned as inhabiting Mains
Hall, and he appears to have been living there in 1613. We
have no documents throwing any certain light upon the way in
which he gained possession of the seat, but it is most probable
that he purchased it. William Hesketh, of Mains Hall, espoused
Anne, the daughter of Hugh Anderton of Euxton, and had issue—Thomas,
Roger, John, William, Hugh, George, Anne, Alice, and
Mary. Thomas, the eldest son, was nine years old in 1613, hence
it is extremely likely that he was the first representative of the
family born at Mains Hall. Thomas Hesketh was twice married;
the first time to Anne, the daughter of Simon Haydock, of Hezantford,
and after her decease, to Mary, the daughter of John Westby,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
of Westby and Mowbreck. The children of his first marriage
were William; Thomas, an officer in the royalist army, and slain
at Brindle in 1651; Anne, who became the wife of Thomas
Nelson, of Fairhurst; and Margaret, afterwards the wife of Major
George Westby, of Upper Rawcliffe. William, the elder son,
married Perpetua, the daughter of Thomas Westby, of Mowbreck,
and had issue—Thomas, born in 1659; William, who died in
infancy; John; Anne, married to Richard Leckonby, of
Leckonby House, Great Eccleston; Helen; Dorothy, married to
Thomas Wilkinson, of Claughton; Perpetua, died in infancy;
and six other daughters, all of whom died in youth. Thomas
Hesketh, the eldest son, left four sons and three daughters—William;
Thomas, who was a priest; John; George; Mary;
Perpetua; and Anne. William Hesketh, the eldest of these sons,
was living at the same time as Thomas Tyldesley, who died in 1714,
and was a frequent visitor at Fox Hall. He married Mary, the
daughter of John Brockholes, of Claughton, and heiress to her
brother William Brockholes, of Claughton, and had issue—Thomas,
Roger, William, Joseph, James, Catherine (an abbess),
Margaret, Anne, Mary (a nun), and Aloysia (a nun). Thomas,
the eldest son, inherited the property of his deceased uncle,
William Brockholes, and assumed the name and arms of
Brockholes. He died in 1766. Roger, the second son, also died in
1766. William, the third son, was born in 1717, and in later years
entered the “Society of Jesus,” dying in 1741. Joseph succeeded
to the Brockholes’ estates on the death of his brother Thomas, and,
like him, assumed the name of Brockholes. He married Constantia,
the daughter of Bazil Fitzherbert, of Swinnerton, and dying in a
few years without issue, was succeeded by his sole remaining
brother, James, who also assumed the name and arms of Brockholes,
and some years afterwards died unmarried. The Brockholes’
property now passed, under the will of Joseph Hesketh-Brockholes,
to William Fitzherbert, the brother of his widow; and
that gentleman, after the manner of his predecessors, assumed the
name of Brockholes. He espoused Mary, the daughter and
co-heiress of James Windsor Heneage, of Cadeby, Lincolnshire,
and had issue—Thomas Fitzherbert-Brockholes, of Claughton;
Catherine, abbess of the Benedictines at Ghent; Margaret; Ann;
Mary, who became a nun; and Frances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span></p>

<h3>HORNBY OF POULTON.</h3>

<p>The Hornbys, of Poulton, were descended from Hugh Hornby,
of Singleton, who died about 1638, after having so far impoverished
himself during the civil wars as to be obliged to
dispose of his estate at Bankfield, inherited from his sister, and
purchased from him by the Harrisons. Geoffrey Hornby, the son
of this gentleman, practised very successfully as a solicitor in
Preston, and probably was the first to acquire property in Poulton.
Edmund Hornby, his eldest son, of Poulton, where he also
practised as a solicitor, and Scale Hall, married Dorothy, the
daughter of Geoffrey Rishton, of Antley, in Lancashire, Member
of Parliament for Preston, and had issue—Geoffrey, George, and
Anne. George, the second son, went into holy orders, became
rector of Whittingham, and subsequently died without surviving
offspring. Anne Hornby married Edmund Cole, of Beaumont
Cote, near Lancaster; and Geoffrey Hornby, who inherited the
Poulton property, as well as Scale Hall, espoused Susannah, the
daughter and heiress of Edward Sherdley, of Kirkham, gentleman,
by whom he had issue—Edmund and Geoffrey, the latter dying
unmarried in 1801. Geoffrey Hornby, who died in 1732, was
buried in Poulton church, being succeeded by his son Edmund,
who came into the possessions at Poulton and Scale. Edmund
Hornby, born in 1728, married Margaret, the daughter of John
Winckley, of Brockholes, and had issue one son, Geoffrey,
and three daughters. At his decease, in 1766, the estates
descended to his only son and heir, Geoffrey, born at Layton
Hall in 1750, who, after being High Sheriff of Lancashire in 1774,
and for some time colonel of a Lancashire regiment of militia,
entered the church and became rector of Winwick. The Rev.
Geoffrey Hornby espoused the Hon. Lucy Smith Stanley,
daughter of Lord Strange, and sister of the twelfth earl of Derby,
and had issue; but the departure of this representative of the
family from the homes of his fathers severed the close connection
between the town of Poulton and the name of Hornby, after an
existence of about a century.</p>

<h3>HORNBY OF RIBBY HALL.</h3>

<p>Richard Hornby, of Newton, who was born in 1613, married
Elizabeth, the daughter of Christopher Walmsley, of Elston, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
had issue a son, William Hornby, also of Newton. That
gentleman had several children by his wife Isabel, the eldest of
whom, Robert Hornby, was born in 1690, and espoused Elizabeth
Sharrock, of Clifton, leaving issue by her at his decease in 1768,
three sons—Hugh, William, and Richard. Hugh Hornby took
up his abode at Kirkham, where he married Margaret, the
daughter and heiress of Joseph Hankinson, of the same place,
and had issue—Joseph, born in 1748; Robert, born in 1750, and
died in 1776; Thomas, of Kirkham, born in 1759, married
Cicely, the daughter of Thomas Langton, of that town, and died
in 1824, having had a family of two sons and five daughters;
William, of Kirkham; John, of Blackburn and Raikes Hall,
Blackpool, born in 1763; Hugh, vicar of St. Michael’s-on-Wyre,
born in 1765; Alice, who became the wife of Richard Birley, of
Blackburn; and Elizabeth. Joseph Hornby was a deputy-lieutenant
of the county of Lancaster, and erected Ribby Hall.
He married Margaret, the daughter of Robert Wilson, of Preston,
by whom he had Hugh; Margaret, who espoused William
Langton, of Manchester; and Alice, who died a spinster. Hugh
Hornby, the only son, born in 1799, succeeded to the Hall and lands
on the death of his father in 1832, and left issue at his own demise,
in 1849, Hugh Hilton, Margaret Anne, and Mary Alice. Hugh
Hilton Hornby, of Ribby Hall, esq., who married his relative,
Georgina, the daughter of the Rev. Robert Hornby, M.A., J.P.,
in 1868, is the present representative of the family, and was born
in 1836.</p>

<p>John Hornby, of Blackburn and Raikes Hall, married Alice
Kendal, a widow, and the daughter of Daniel Backhouse, of
Liverpool, by whom he had four sons—Daniel, born in 1800, who
espoused Frances, daughter of John Birley, of Manchester, and
dying in 1863, left issue, Fanny Backhouse and Margaret Alice
Hornby; Robert, born in 1804, M.A., a clergyman and justice of the
peace, who married Maria Leyland, daughter of Sir William
Fielden, bart., and had issue, Robert Montagu, William St.
John Sumner, Leyland, Frederick Fielden, Henry Wallace,
Hugh, and ten daughters, the first and third sons being captains
in the army, and the second in the royal navy; William
Henry, of Staining Hall, J.P. and D.L., born in 1805, and Member
of Parliament for Blackburn from 1857 to 1869, married<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
Susannah, only child of Edward Birley, of Kirkham, by whom
he had John, Edward Kenworthy, Henry Sudell, William Henry,
Cecil Lumsden, Albert Neilson, Charles Herbert, Elizabeth
Henriana, Frances Mary, Augusta Margaret, and Caroline
Louisa, of whom Edward Kenworthy Hornby, esq., has sat as
M.P. for Blackburn; John, M.A., formerly M.P. for Blackburn,
and born 1810, married Margaret, daughter of the Rev. Christopher
Bird, having issue, John Frederick, Wilfrid Bird, Edith
Diana, and Clara Margaret. The Rev. Hugh Hornby, M.A.,
sixth son of Hugh Hornby, of Kirkham, was vicar of St.
Michael’s-on-Wyre, and espoused Ann, daughter of Dr. Joshua
Starky, a physician, of Redbales, having issue one son, William,
now the Venerable Archdeacon Hornby, M.A., and the present
vicar of St. Michael’s, born in 1810. Archdeacon Hornby
married, firstly, Ellen, daughter of William Cross, esq., of Red
Scar, and four years after her decease, in 1844, Susan Charlotte,
daughter of Admiral Sir Phipps Hornby, K.C.B. The offspring
of the earlier union were two—William Hugh and Joseph Starky,
both of whom died young; whilst those of the second marriage
are—William, Hugh Phipps, Phipps John, James John, William
Starky, Susan, and Anne Lucy, the eldest of whom, William,
died in 1858, aged thirteen years.</p>

<h3>LECKONBY OF LECKONBY HOUSE.</h3>

<p>John Leckonby, the earliest of the name we find mentioned
as connected with Great Eccleston, on the borders of which stood
Leckonby House, was living in 1621, and was twice married—first
to Alice, the daughter of Thomas Singleton, of Staining
Hall, and subsequently, in 1625, to Marie, the daughter of Henry
Preston, of Preston. Richard Leckonby, the eldest son and heir,
was the offspring of his first marriage, and like his father, became
involved in the civil wars on the royal side. Richard succeeded
to the family estates sometime before 1646, for in that year he
compounded for them with Parliament. He left issue at his
death in 1669, by his wife, Isabel, a numerous family—John;
Richard, of Elswick; George; William, of Elswick; Sarah;
Martha; and Mary, who married Gilbert Whiteside, of Marton,
gentleman. John Leckonby inherited the estate, and resided at
the ancestral mansion—Leckonby House. He married Ann, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
daughter of William Thompson, gent., of Little Eccleston, but
dying without offspring, was succeeded by his brother Richard,
who had espoused Ann, the daughter of William Hesketh, of Mains
Hall. The children of Richard Leckonby, of Leckonby House,
were William; Richard, who was born in 1696, and afterwards
became a Romish missionary; and Thomas, also a missionary, who
died at Maryland in 1734. William Leckonby, the eldest son,
occupied Leckonby House, after the decease of his father, as
holder of the hereditary estates. He espoused Anne, the daughter
of Thomas Hothersall, of Hothersall Hall, and sister and co-heiress
of John Hothersall, and had issue—Richard; Thomas,
born in 1717, who entered the Order of Jesus; William, of
Elswick, who died in 1784; Anne, born in 1706; Bridget; and
Mary, who became the wife of Thomas Singleton, of Barnacre-with-Bonds,
gent. Richard Leckonby, who succeeded his father
in 1728, inherited, in addition to the lands in Great Eccleston
and Elswick, the extensive manor of Hothersall, and by his
marriage with Mary, the daughter of William Hawthornthwaite,
of Catshaw, gent., came into possession, on the death of her
brother John Hawthornthwaite in 1760, of Catshaw, Lower
Wyersdale, Hale, Luddocks, and Stockenbridge. Notwithstanding
these large accessions to the original family domain, Richard
Leckonby managed, by a long career of dissipation and extravagance,
to run through his resources, mortgaging his estates, and
bringing himself and his family to comparative poverty. He died
in 1783, at about 68 years of age, having survived his wife many
years, and was buried at St. Michael’s-on-Wyre. His offspring
were two sons, the elder of whom was thrown from a pony and
killed in early youth; whilst the second, William, met with a
fatal accident when hunting in Wyersdale the year before the
death of his father. William Leckonby, left, at his untimely
death, by his wife, Elizabeth, the daughter of James Taylor, of
Goosnargh, gent., two sons and a daughter. Of these children,
Richard, the eldest, died in 1795, when only sixteen years of age;
James, the second son, died in infancy; and Mary, their sister,
married in 1799, at the age of twenty-two years, Thomas Henry
Hale Phipps, of Leighton House, Wiltshire, a justice of the peace
and deputy-lieutenant of his county, by which union, Leckonby
of Leckonby House, became a title of the past.</p>

<h3>LEYLAND OF LEYLAND HOUSE AND KELLAMERGH.</h3>

<p>Leyland House was occupied during the latter half of the
seventeenth and part of the eighteenth centuries by a family of
wealth and position, named the Leylands of Kellamergh. Christopher
Leyland, the first of the line recorded, resided at Leyland
House in 1660, and married in 1665, Margaret Andrew, of Lea,
by whom he had issue—John; Ralph, died in 1675; Anne, born
1671; Ellen, born 1679; Susan, died 1670; another Ralph, born
1680 and died 1711; Francis, died 1674; Bridget, died 1687;
Roger, died 1678; and Thomas, who died in 1682.</p>

<p>John Leyland, who succeeded to the Kellamergh property and
Leyland House on the death of his father in 1716, married, in
1693, Elizabeth Whitehead, and had offspring—Christopher, born
1694; Thomas, born 1699, afterwards in holy orders; Joseph,
died 1709; Ralph, born 1712; John, died 1716; and William,
who espoused Cicely, widow of Edward Rigby, of Freckleton, and
daughter of Thomas Shepherd Birley, by whom he had two
daughters, one of whom, Jane Leyland, subsequently married
Thomas Langton.</p>

<p>Christopher Leyland inherited Kellamergh and the mansion on
the demise of his father, John Leyland, in 1745, and at his own
death, some years later, left one child, Elizabeth, who married, as
her second husband, the Rev. Edward Whitehead, vicar of
Bolton.</p>

<h3>LONGWORTH OF ST. MICHAEL’S HALL.</h3>

<p>The family of Longworths, inhabiting St. Michael’s Hall until
the early part of the eighteenth century, was descended from the
Longworths, of Longworth, through Ralph, a younger son of
Christopher Longworth, of Longworth, by his wife Alice, the
daughter of Thomas Standish, of Duxbury. Ralph Longworth
married Anne, the daughter of Thomas Kitchen, and had issue
two sons and one daughter. Robert, the younger son, espoused
Helen Hudson, whilst Elizabeth, his sister, married Richard
Blackburne, and afterwards Thomas Bell, of Kirkland. Richard,
the elder son and heir, is the first of the Longworths, described
as of St. Michael’s Hall, in Upper Rawcliffe. He married
Margaret, the daughter of George Cumming, of Upper Rawcliffe,
and had issue—Ralph, Thomas, Lawrence, Christopher, Anne,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
Elizabeth, and Katherine. Ralph, the eldest son, espoused Jane,
the daughter of Richard Cross, of Cross Hall, in Chorley parish,
but further than this fact, we have no information concerning
him. The family of the Crosses, into which he married, belonged to
Liverpool, and their old country seat, Cross Hall, is now converted
into cottages and workshops. Thomas Longworth, the
second son, born in 1622, resided at St. Michael’s Hall, and
married Cicely, the daughter of Nicholas Wilkinson, of Kirkland,
by whom he had one son—Richard Longworth. The latter
representative, having succeeded in course of time to the Hall and
estates, was a justice of the peace for the county of Lancaster,
and on terms of intimacy with Thomas Tyldesley, of Fox Hall,
Edward Veale, of Whinney Heys, William Hesketh, of Mains
Hall, and a number of other leading gentry in the district. He
married Fleetwood, the daughter of Edward Shutteworth, of
Larbrick, and Thornton Hall, and left at his demise one son—Edward
Longworth, who became a doctor of medicine, and resided
at St. Michael’s Hall until 1725, about which time he removed to
Penrith, in the county of Cumberland.</p>

<h3>PARKER OF BRADKIRK HALL.</h3>

<p>The Parkers, who inhabited Bradkirk Hall for over a hundred
years, were relatives of the Derby family, and came originally
from Breightmet Hall, near Bolton, where they had lived for
many centuries. William Parker, of Bradkirk Hall, who died in
1609, and was buried at Kirkham, is the first of whom we have
any authentic account, and he is stated to have married Margaret,
the daughter of Robert Shaw, of Crompton. The children
springing from that union were—John, who inherited Bradkirk
Hall; Thomas, of Bidstone, in the county of Chester; and Henry,
who espoused, in 1609, Alice Threlfall, and became the founder of
the family of Parkers of Whittingham. John Parker, of Bradkirk
Hall, married Margaret, the daughter and co-heiress of Anthony
Parker, of Radham Park, Yorkshire; and after her decease he
espoused Alice, the daughter of Richard Mason, of Up-Holland,
near Wigan, by whom he had three sons and one daughter—William,
Richard, John, and Margaret. The offspring of his
first marriage were Anthony, Elizabeth, Jennet, Anne, Alice, and
Christopher. Anthony died unmarried, and Christopher, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
second son, born in 1625, succeeded to Bradkirk Hall on the
demise of his father. He was a justice of the peace for the
county of Lancaster, and married Katherine, sister to James Lowde,
of Kirkham, and daughter of Ralph Lowde, of Norfolk. His
children were Anthony; Alexander, who married Dorothy, the
daughter of Thomas Westby, of Mowbreck; John, William,
Gerrard, Christopher, Margaret, Mary, and Jane, the last married
John Westby, of Mowbreck, at Poulton church, in 1688.
Anthony Parker, the eldest son, born in 1657, lived at Bradkirk
Hall, and espoused Mary, the daughter of Sir Thomas Stringer,
sergeant-at-law, by whom he had issue—Christopher, Catherine,
and Rebecca, who died young. Christopher Parker inherited
Bradkirk Hall, and was Member of Parliament for Clitheroe in
1708. He died unmarried about 1713, and the Hall and estates
passed by will to his sister Catherine, the wife of Thomas Stanley,
of Cross Hall, in Ormskirk Parish, conjointly with her uncle
Alexander Parker. In 1723 the possessions of the deceased
Christopher Parker in Lancashire and Yorkshire were sold by
Catherine Stanley and Alexander Parker. The latter, however,
resided at Bradkirk Hall for some time after that date with his
wife Dorothy, the daughter, as before stated, of Thomas Westby of
Mowbreck, by whom he had nine sons and two daughters. The
sons appear to have died without issue, and one of the daughters,
Dorothy, married ⸺ Cowburn, whilst the other Katherine, became
the wife of William Jump, of Hesketh Bank.</p>

<h3>RIGBY OF LAYTON HALL.</h3>

<p>The Rigbys, of Layton, were descended from Adam Rigby, of
Wigan, who married Alice, the daughter of ⸺ Middleton, of
Leighton, and had issue—John, Alexander, and Ellen. John
Rigby, of Wigan, married Joanna, the daughter of Gilbert
Molyneux, of Hawkley, and became the founder of the family
of Rigby of Middleton. Ellen became the wife of Hugh Forth;
and Alexander Rigby, of Burgh Hall, in the township of
Duxbury, espoused Joanna, the daughter of William Lathbroke,
by whom he had three sons and one daughter—Edward, Roger,
Alexander, and Anne. Edward Rigby, of Burgh, who purchased
the estate of Woodenshaw from William, earl of Derby, in 1595,
was the first of the family, as far as can be ascertained, who held<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
property in the Fylde, and from his <i>Inq. post mortem</i>, dated
1629-30, we find that he possessed Laiton, Great Laiton,
Little Laiton, Warbrecke, Blackepool, and Marton, besides
other estates in Broughton in Furness, Lancaster, Chorley,
etc. This gentleman married Dorothy, the daughter of Hugh
Anderton, of Euxton, and had issue—Alexander, Hugh, Alice,
Jane, and Dorothy. Alexander Rigby, who was born in 1583,
succeeded to Layton Hall, and Burgh, on the death of his father,
and afterwards married Katherine, the daughter of Sir Edward
Brabazon, of Nether Whitacre, in the county of Warwick. In
1641, during the time of Charles I., he was a colonel in the
king’s forces, and was, somewhere about that period, removed
from the commission of the peace for this county by command of
Parliament on account of certain charges made against him of
favouring the royal party. In 1646 he compounded for his
sequestrated estates by paying £381 3s. 4d. His offspring were
Edward, of Burgh, and Layton Hall; Thomas, rector of St. Mary’s,
Dublin; William, a merchant; Mary, wife of John Moore, of
Bank Hall; Elizabeth, wife of Edward Chisenhall, of Chisenhall;
Jane, the wife of the Rev. Paul Lathome, rector of Standish; and
Alexander, who died in infancy. Edward, the eldest son, who
died before his father, married Mary, the daughter of Edward
Hyde, of Norbury, and left issue—Alexander, William, Hamlet,
Robert, Richard, Mary, and Dorothy. Alexander Rigby, the heir,
who was born in 1634, was also an officer in the royalist army,
and erected a monument to Sir Thomas Tyldesley near the spot
where he was slain at Wigan-lane, at which battle “the grateful
erector” fought as cornet. He was High Sheriff of Lancashire
in 1677 and 1678, and married Alena, the daughter of George
Birch, of Birch Hall, near Manchester. His children were
Edward, Alexander, Mary, Alice, Eleanor, and Elizabeth. Of
Edward we have no account beyond the fact that he was born in
1658, and consequently must conclude that he died young.
Alexander, the second son, succeeded to the estates, and was
knighted for some reason, which cannot be discovered. He was
High Sheriff of the county in 1691-2. Mary, the eldest daughter,
married Thomas Tyldesley, of Fox Hall, and was co-heiress with
Elizabeth, wife, and subsequently, in 1720, widow of ⸺ Colley,
to her brother, Sir Alexander Rigby, of Layton Hall and Burgh,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
who married Alice, the daughter of Thomas Clifton, of Clifton,
Westby, and Lytham, but left no surviving offspring. Sir
Alexander Rigby is reputed to have been a gambler, and to have
so impoverished his estates, already seriously injured by the
attachment of his family to the fortunes of Charles I. and II.,
that he was compelled to dispose of his possessions in Poulton
and Layton for the benefit of his creditors. He also appears to
have been imprisoned for debt until released by an act of Parliament,
passed in the first year of George I., and his property
vested in trustees. His estates in Layton and Poulton were sold
for £19,200. After his liberation he resided in Poulton at his
house on the south side of the Market-place, where the family
arms, bearing the date 1693, may still be seen fixed on the outer
wall. The pew of the Rigbys is still in existence in the parish
church of that town, and has carved on its door the initials
A. R., and the date 1636, separated by a goat’s head, the crest of
the family.</p>

<h3>SINGLETON OF STAINING HALL.</h3>

<p>There is every reason to suppose that the Singletons who
resided at Staining Hall during the greater part of two centuries
were a branch of the family founded in the Fylde by Alan de
Singleton, of Singleton. George, the son of Robert Singleton by
his wife Helen, the daughter of John Westby, of Mowbreck,
purchased the hamlet and manor of Staining from Sir Thomas
Holt, of Grislehurst, and was the first of the name to occupy the
Hall. He married Mary Osbaldeston, and left issue at his death,
in 1552, William, the eldest; Hugh, who espoused Mary, sister
of William Carleton, of Carleton, and left a son, William, who
died without issue; Richard; Lawrence; and Margaret, the wife
of Lawrence Carleton, heir and subsequently successor to his
brother William. William Singleton, of Staining, became allied
to Alice, the daughter and heiress of Thomas ffarington, by whom
he had Thomas, John, George, Richard, Helen, and Margaret.
On the demise of his father in 1556, Thomas, the heir, came into
possession of the estate; he married Alice, the daughter of James
Massey, and had one child, a daughter, Ellen, who espoused John
Massey, of Layton. Thomas Singleton died in 1563, and was
succeeded by his brother John, who had married Thomasine, the
daughter of Robert Anderton, and had issue two daughters, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
elder of whom, Alice, became the wife of Henry Huxley, of
Birkenhead, and the younger, Elizabeth, of James Massey, of
Strangeways. John Singleton died in 1590, and was in his turn
succeeded by the next male representative, his brother George,
who had issue by his wife Mary, the daughter of John Houghton,
of Penwortham or Pendleton, two sons and a daughter—Thomas,
George, and Anne, the wife of Robert Parkinson, of Fairsnape.
Thomas Singleton, the heir, became lord of Staining in 1597,
previously to which he had espoused Cicely, the daughter of
William Gerard, of Ince, and had issue Thomas, John, Mary, Grace,
Alice, the last of whom married John Leckonby, of Great Eccleston,
and Anne, the wife of Richard Bamber, of the Moor, near Poulton.
Thomas Singleton, the eldest son, succeeded to the lordship in
the natural course of events, and formed an alliance with Dorothy,
the daughter of James Anderton, of Clayton, who was left a
widow in 1643, when her husband was slain at Newbury Fight
in command of a company of royalists. The offspring of
Thomas and Dorothy Singleton were John, born in 1635 and
died in 1668, who espoused Jane, the daughter of Edmund
Fleetwood, of Rossall; Thomas, who died childless; George;
James; Anne, of Bardsea, a spinster, living in 1690; Mary, the
wife of John Mayfield; and Dorothy, the wife of Alexander
Butler, of Todderstaff Hall. John Singleton, of Staining, whose
widow married Thomas Cole, of Beaumont, near Lancaster,
justice of the peace, and deputy-lieutenant, had no progeny, and
the manor passed, either at once, or after the death of the next
brother, Thomas, to George Singleton, who had possession in
1679, but was dead in 1690, never having been married. He held
Staining, Hardhorne, Todderstaff, and Carleton manors or estates.
The whole of the property descended to John Mayfield, the son
and heir of his sister Mary, whose husband, John Mayfield, was
dead. John Mayfield, of Staining, etc., ultimately died without
issue, and was succeeded by his nephew and heir-at-law, William
Blackburn, of Great Eccleston, whose offspring were James, and
Gabriel, under age in 1755.</p>

<h3>STANLEY OF GREAT ECCLESTON HALL.</h3>

<p>The Stanleys, of Great Eccleston, were descended from Henry,
the fourth earl of Derby, who was born in 1531, through Thomas
Stanley, one of his illegitimate children by Jane Halsall, of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
Knowsley, the others being Dorothy and Ursula. Thomas
Stanley settled at Great Eccleston Hall, probably acquired by
purchase, and married Mary, the relict of Richard Barton, of
Barton, near Preston, and the daughter of Robert Hesketh, of
Rufford. The offspring of that union were—Richard Stanley;
Fernando Stanley, of Broughton, who died unmarried in 1664;
and Jane Stanley, who was married to Henry Butler, of Rawcliffe
Hall. Richard Stanley, the eldest son, succeeded to Great
Eccleston Hall and estate on the death of his father, and espoused
Mary, the daughter and sole heiress of Lambert Tyldesley, of
Garret, by whom he had one son, Thomas Stanley, who in course
of time inherited the Eccleston property, and married Frances,
the daughter of Major-General Sir Thomas Tyldesley, of
Tyldesley and Myerscough Lodge, the famous royalist officer slain
at the battle of Wigan-lane in 1651. Richard Stanley, the only
child of this marriage, resided at Great Eccleston Hall, and
espoused Anne, the daughter and eventually co-heiress of Thomas
Culcheth, of Culcheth, by whom he had two sons—Thomas and
Henry Stanley. Richard Stanley, who died in 1714, was buried
at St. Michael’s church, and the following extract is taken from
the diary of Thomas Tyldesley, of Fox Hall, the grandson of Sir
Thomas Tyldesley, and consequently Richard Stanley’s cousin,
who at that time appears to have been in failing health, and
whose death occurred on the 26th of January in the ensuing
year:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“October 16, 1714.—Wentt in ye morning to the ffuneral off Dick Stanley.
Partᵈ with Mr. Brandon att Dick Jackson’s dor; but fell at Staven’s Poole; and
soe wentt home.”</p>

</div>

<p>It may here be mentioned that for two years the cousins had
not been on very friendly terms, owing to Richard Stanley having
at a meeting of creditors, summoned by Thomas Tyldesley in
1712, when he had fallen too deeply into debt, objected to an
allowance being made to Winefride and Agatha, daughters of
Thomas Tyldesley by a second marriage. We may form some
idea of the strong feeling existing between them from an entry
made on the 7th of May, 1712, by Thomas Tyldesley in his diary:—“Stanley—Dicke—very
bitter against my two poor girlles, and
declared he would bee hanged beffor they had one penny allowed;
yet my honest and never-to-be-forgotten true friend Winckley,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
with much art and sence, soe perswaded the otheʳ refferys that
the slaving puppy was compelled to consent to a small allowance
to be sedulled—viz.: £100 each.” After the decease of Richard
Stanley, Great Eccleston Hall, for some reason we are unable to
explain, passed into the possession of Thomas Westby, of Upper
Rawcliffe.</p>

<h3>TYLDESLEY OF FOX HALL.</h3>

<p>The family which inhabited the ancient mansion of Fox Hall
in the time of Charles II., and for many subsequent years, sprang
originally from the small village of Tyldesley, near Bolton-le-moors.
When or how they first became associated with the
latter place is impossible to determine, as no authentic documents
bearing on the subject can be discovered; but that they must
have been established in or connected with the neighbourhood at
an early epoch is shown by the fact that Henry de Tyldesley held
the tenth part of a Knight’s fee in Tyldesley during the reign of
Edward I., 1272-1307. A Richard de Tyldesley was lord of the
manor of Tyldesley towards the close of the sovereignty of this
monarch, and there is sufficient evidence to warrant the
assumption that he was the son and heir of Henry de Tyldesley.</p>

<p>At a later period Thurstan de Tyldesley, a lineal descendant,
who is accredited with having done much to improve his native
village, and having built Wardley Hall, near Manchester, about
1547, was a justice of the peace for the county of Lancaster, and
Receiver-General for the Isle of Man in 1532. He was on
intimate and friendly terms with the earl of Derby, and we may
safely conjecture that the members of the two houses had for long
been familiarly known to each other, as we read that in 1405
Henry IV. granted a letter of protection to William de Stanley,
knt., John de Tyldesley, and several more, when they set out to
take possession of the Isle of Man and Peel Castle. In 1417,
when Sir John de Stanley, lord of the same island, was summoned
to England, he left Thurston de Tyldesley, a magistrate, to
officiate as governor during his absence. The Tyldesleys held
extensive lands in Wardley, Morleys, Myerscough, and Tyldesley,
having seats at the three first-named manors. Thurstan de
Tyldesley, who erected Wardley Hall, was twice married and
had issue by each wife. To the offspring of the first, Parnell,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
daughter of Geoffrey Shakerley, of Shakerley, he left Tyldesley
and Wardley; and to those of his second, Jane, daughter of Ralph
Langton, baron of Newton, he bequeathed Myerscough, and some
minor property. There is nothing calling for special notice
concerning any, except two, of the descendants from the first
marriage—Sir Thomas Tyldesley, a great-grandson, attorney-general
for Lancashire in the reign of James I.; and his son, who
did not survive him many months, and terminated the elder
branch. In consequence of this failure of issue the Tyldesley
estate, but not Wardley, which had been sold, passed to the
representatives of Thurstan’s children by his second wife. The
eldest son of the second alliance, Edward, had espoused Anne,
the daughter and heiress of Thomas Leyland, of Morleys, and,
subsequently, inherited the manor and Hall of Morleys. The
grandson and namesake of Edward Tyldesley, of Morleys and
Tyldesley, who was born in 1585, and died in 1618, entertained
James I. for three days at his seat, Myerscough Lodge, in 1617.
Edward Tyldesley, of Myerscough, was the father of Major-General
Sir Thomas Tyldesley, knt., who so greatly distinguished
himself, by his fidelity and valour, in the wars between King and
Parliament. In those sanguinary and calamitous struggles he
served under the standard of royalty. He was slain at the battle
of Wigan-lane in 1651; and as a mark of esteem for his many
virtues and gallant deeds a monument was erected, near the spot
where he fell, in 1679, by Alexander Rigby, of Layton Hall, High
Sheriff for the county of Lancaster. The monument was inscribed
as under:—</p>

<p class="center">“An high Act of Gratitude, which conveys the Memory of<br />
SIR THOMAS TYLDESLEY<br />
To posterity,<br />
Who served King Charles the First as Lieutenant-Colonel at Edge-Hill Battle,<br />
After raising regiments of Horse, Foot, and Dragoons,<br />
and for<br />
The desperate storming of Burton on Trent, over a bridge of 36 arches,<br />
<span class="smcap">Received the Honour of Knighthood</span>.<br />
He afterwards served in all the wars in great command,<br />

To whom the grateful erector, Alexander Rigby, Esq., was Cornet;<br />
And when he was High Sheriff of this county, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1679,<br />
Placed the high obligation on the whole Family of the Tyldesleys,<br />
To follow the noble example of their Loyal Ancestor.”</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Tyldesley married Frances, daughter of Ralph
Standish, of Standish, and had issue—Edward, born in 1635;
Thomas, born in 1642; Ralph, born in 1644; Bridget, who
became the wife of Henry Blundell, of Ince Blundell; Elizabeth;
Frances, wife of Thomas Stanley, of Great Eccleston; Anne, who
was abbess of the English nuns at Paris in 1721; Dorothy; Mary,
wife of Richard Crane; and Margaret.</p>

<p>Edward Tyldesley, the eldest son and heir, followed in the
footsteps of his father, and was a staunch supporter of Charles II.
When that monarch had been restored to the throne of his
ancestors he purposed creating a fresh order of Knighthood,
called the Royal Oak,<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> wherewith to reward a number of his
faithful adherents, whose social positions were of sufficient
standing to render them suitable recipients of the honour.
Edward Tyldesley was amongst those selected; but the design
was abandoned by the king under the advice of his ministers,
who considered that it was likely to produce jealousy and dissatisfaction
in many quarters, and might prove inimical to the
peace of the nation. Under an impression, which afterwards
proved erroneous, that Charles II. intended to confer upon him
the lands of Layton Hawes, in recognition of the loyal services of
his father and himself, Edward Tyldesley erected a residence,
called Fox Hall, near its borders, where he lived during certain
portions of the year until his death, which occurred between 1685
and 1687. Edward Tyldesley espoused Anne, daughter of Sir
Thomas Fleetwood, of Colwich, in Staffordshire, and baron of
Newton, in Lancashire; and after her decease, Elizabeth, daughter
of Adam Beaumont, of Whitley, by whom he had only one child,
Catherine Tyldesley, of Preston. The offspring of his union with
Anne Fleetwood were Thomas, Edward, Frances, and Maria.
Thomas Tyldesley succeeded to the estates, on the decease of his
father, with the exception of Tyldesley, which had been sold by
Edward Tyldesley in 1685, and resided during a considerable part<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
of his life at Fox Hall, and occasionally at Myerscough Lodge.
Thomas Tyldesley was born in 1657, and at twenty-two years of
age married Eleanor, daughter and co-heiress of Thomas Holcroft,
of Holcroft, by whom he had Edward, Dorothy, Frances,
Elizabeth, Eleanor, and Mary. After the death of his wife
Eleanor, Thomas Tyldesley espoused Mary, sister and co-heiress
of Sir Alexander Rigby, of Layton Hall, and had issue—Charles,
Fleetwood, James, Agatha, and Winefrid. Thomas Tyldesley,
whilst living at Fox Hall, employed his time chiefly in field
sports, visits amongst the neighbouring gentry, and frequent
excursions to his more distant friends, as we learn from his diary,
a portion of which is still preserved. The following extracts from
it will illustrate what formed the favourite recreations of the

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span></p>

<p>The diarist, Thomas Tyldesley, died in 1715, before the outbreak
of the rebellion, and was buried at Churchtown, near Garstang.
Edward Tyldesley, his eldest son, who succeeded him, had two
children by his wife Dorothy—James and Catherine. He was
accused, tried, and acquitted of taking part with the rebels of 1715,
although the evidence clearly convicted him of having led a body
of men against the king’s forces. At the death of Edward
Tyldesley, in 1725, Myerscough no longer belonged to the family,
but Holcroft, acquired by marriage in 1679, passed to his son James,
who twenty years later served with the troops of Prince Charles,
the younger pretender, and died in 1765. The offspring of James
Tyldesley by Sarah, his wife, were Thomas, Charles, James, Henry,
and Jane, all of whom with their descendants seem to have sold or
mortgaged the remnants of the once large estates, and gradually
drifted into poverty and obscurity.</p>

<p>It will not be out of place in concluding the notice of a family
connected with the earliest infancy of Blackpool, to state something
of the character and habits of Thomas Tyldesley, of Fox
Hall, as disclosed by, and deduced from, the entries in his diary,
which unfortunately comprises only the last three years of his
life. At the present time the appearance of a party of gentlemen
in this neighbourhood decorated with curled wigs, surmounted by
three-cornered hats, and habited in long-figured waistcoats, plush
breeches, and red-heeled boots, would excite no little astonishment,
yet in the days of the diarist the sight must have been one of
usual occurrence, for such was the style of costume worn by
the wealthier classes. The lower classes were clothed in garments
made from the undyed wool of the sheep and called hodden gray.</p>

<p>Thomas Tyldesley was a great equestrian, his journeys being
so frequent and rapid that it is difficult to be certain of his
whereabouts when he finished his day’s work and its minute
record, with the final “soe to beed.” He was on terms of
intimacy and friendship with the Rigbys of Layton, the Veales
of Whinney Heys, the Westbys of Burn Hall, and all the wealthy
families in the neighbourhood. Fishing, hunting, coursing, and
shooting were his favourite recreations. Nor was he unmindful
in the midst of these amusements of the interests of his farm, as
the accompanying remarks amply testify:—“Very bussy all
morning in my hay;” and “Alday in the house and my garden,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
bussy transplanting colleflowʳ and cabage plants;” whilst at other
times we find him in communication with various tenants relative
to some portion or other of the Myerscough property. Unless
confined to bed by gout or rheumatism, and the self-imposed, but
fearful, “Phissickings” he underwent, swallowing doses whose
magnitude alone would appal most men of modern days, he
was ever actively engaged in either business or pleasure. Every
item of disbursement and every circumstance that occurred, even
to the most trivial, has found a place in his diary, and from
it we learn that while evidently anxious to avoid unnecessary
expenditure, he was neither parsimonious nor illiberal, always
recompensing those who had been put to any trouble on his
account, and paying his share of each friendly gathering with a
scrupulous exactness. There is, however, a satisfaction expressed
in the words, “but spent noe thing,” after the brief notice of the
horse-race he had attended on the Hawes, which, when we call to
mind his natural generosity, showed that his income required care
in its expenditure, and was barely sufficient to support the position
he held by birth. Many other entries in his diary prove that he
was frequently short of money, and as his mode of living appears
to have been far from extravagant, it seems difficult at first sight
to account for the circumstance. But when we discover that he
had for years been connected, as one of the leading members and
promoters, with a Catholic and Jacobite Society at Walton-le-dale,
having for its object the restoration of the Stuarts, then in
exile, and remember that a scheme of such magnitude and
importance could not possibly be matured or kept in activity
without the purses of its more earnest supporters suffering to a
great extent, we obtain in some measure an explanation of the
matter.</p>

<p>The character of Thomas Tyldesley, as gleaned from his diary,
may be summarised as follows:—He was in every sense a country
gentleman, fond of field sports, happy on his farm, thoughtful of
the condition and comfort of his cattle, although sometimes given
to hard, or at least far, riding; for the rest, he was active and
intelligent, liberal to his dependants, careful in his household, and
strictly honourable in all his dealings, but above all he had an
earnest and deep reverence for his creed and principles that spared
no sacrifice.</p>

<h3>VEALE OF WHINNEY HEYS.</h3>

<p>The Veales, of Whinney Heys, who during a time of considerable
license and extravagance, were renowned for their piety and
frugality, were descended from John Veale, of Mythorp. This
gentleman was living during the reign of Elizabeth, and furnished
1 caliver and 1 morion at the military muster which took
place in 1574. Francis Veale, the son of John Veale, of Mythorp,
is the first of the name we find described as of Whinney Heys.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
Francis Veale left a son, Edward, who resided at Whinney Heys,
and appeared amongst the list of Free-tenants of Amounderness
in 1621. According to Sir William Dugdale, he was a justice of
the peace for Lancashire in the reigns of James I. and Charles I.
Edward Veale married Ellen, the daughter and co-heiress, with
her younger sister Alice, of John Massey, of Layton and Carleton,
and in that way the Veales acquired much of their property in
the neighbourhood of Whinney Heys. The offspring of this
union were—John, who was born in 1605; Massey; Edward;
Francis; Singleton; Ellen, who married Thomas Heardson, of
Cambridge; Juliana; Dorothy, who married George Sharples, of
Freckleton; Anne, who became the wife of John Austin, of
London; Alice; and Frances, the wife of William Wombwell,
of London. The maiden name of Mrs. Edward Veale’s mother
was Singleton, she being the daughter of Thomas Singleton, of
Staining Hall, and for that reason we find the name borne by one
of the sons of Edward Veale. John Veale, the eldest son,
succeeded to the Hall and estate, and espoused Dorothy, the
daughter of Matthew Jepson, of Hawkswell, in Yorkshire. John
Veale was fifty-nine years of age in 1664, and at that date entered
the names of his ancestors, etc., before Sir William Dugdale at
Preston, who was on his heraldic visitation in Lancashire. The
children of John Veale, by Dorothy, his wife, were—John,
Edward, Helen, Susan, and Jane. John Veale, who was twenty
years old in 1664, became the representative of the family on the
decease of his father, some time previous to which he had
married Susannah, the daughter of Geoffrey Rishton, of Antley,
and by her had issue—Edward, born in 1680; Ellen, the wife of
Richard Sherdley, of Kirkham, born in 1698; and Dorothy, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
died unmarried in 1747, aged 76 years. John Veale was a justice
of the peace for this county, and died in 1704. After the death of
John Veale, whose remains were interred at Bispham church,
Edward, his only son, inherited the lands and Hall of Whinney
Heys. Edward Veale was living at the same time as Thomas
Tyldesley, of Fox Hall, Blackpool, and between the two
gentlemen a close friendship seems to have existed, as we glean
from the diary of the latter, in which Edward Veale is frequently
mentioned, being invariably, for some reason, styled Captain,—perhaps
he once held that rank in some temporary or reserve
force, for there is no record of his ever having been connected
with the regular troops. The following is a short extract from
the above diary in 1712:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Aug. 2.—Att my returne I wentt to yᵉ King’s Arms, and got my dinʳ with
Broʳ. We spent 1s. a pice in whitte wine, and as wee went through yᵉ hall
met with Just. Longworth,<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> Capᵗᵗ Veale, Just. Pearson, Franke Nickinson, and
small Lᵈ of Roshall.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> Wee were very merry upon yᵉ small Lord, and spent 1s.
a pice in sack and white wine, wʰ elevated yᵉ petite Lᵈ that before he went to
bed he tucke yᵉ ffriedom of biting his man Sharocke’s thumb off just beyond
yᵉ nail. I found cos. W: W: att home.”</p>

</div>

<p>Edward left issue at his death in 1723, at forty-three years of
age—John, Sarah, and Susannah. John Veale, the heir, entered
into holy orders, and subsequently died unmarried. Sarah and
Susannah Veale, the co-heiresses of their brother, married
respectively Edward Fleetwood, of Rossall Hall (the small lord),
and John Fayle, of the Holmes, Thornton, who erected Bridge
House in Bispham, after the model of the original Hall of
Whinney Heys. The lands and residence of Whinney Heys
eventually passed into the possession of the Fleetwoods, of
Rossall, through the wife of Edward Fleetwood. The Veales
were Puritans in religion, and one of the family, named Edward
Veale, whose father was the third son of Edward and Ellen Veale
mentioned above, and a lay member of the Presbyterian Classis for
this district in the time of the Commonwealth, attained considerable
eminence, first as a Puritan preacher and afterwards as a
Nonconformist minister. Calamy, in his <i>Nonconformist Memorial</i>,
tells us that “Mr. Edward Veale, of Christ Church, Oxford,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
afterwards of Trinity College, Dublin, was ordained at Winwick in
Lancashire, August 4th, 1657. When he left Ireland he brought
with him a testimonial of his being ‘a learned, orthodox minister,
of a sober, pious, and peaceable conversation, who during his
abode at the college was eminently useful for the instruction of
youth, and whose ministry had been often exercised in and about
the city of Dublin with great satisfaction to the godly, until he
was deprived of his fellowship for nonconformity to the ceremonies
imposed in the church, and for joining with other
ministers in their endeavours for a reformation;’ signed by
Richard Charnock and six other respectable ministers. He
became chaplain to Sir William Waller, in Middlesex, and
afterwards settled as a Nonconformist pastor in Wapping, where
he lived to a good old age. He had several pupils, to whom he
read university learning, who were afterwards useful persons;
one of whom was Mr. Nathaniel Taylor. He died June 6th,
1708, aged 76. His funeral sermon was preached by Mr. T.
Symonds, who succeeded him.”</p>

<h3>WESTBY OF MOWBRECK HALL AND BURN HALL.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></h3>

<p>The family of this name, so long associated with the township
of Medlar-with-Wesham, in the parish of Kirkham, is descended
from the Westbys of Westby, in the county of York.</p>

<p>William Westby, who was under-sheriff of Lancashire in 1345,
is the first of the name, we can find, residing at Mowbreck; and
a great-grandson of his, named William Westby, is recorded as
inheriting the Mowbreck and Westby property in the reign of
Henry VI., 1422-61. John Westby, the son of the latter William,
succeeded to the estates, residing, like his ancestors, at Mowbreck
Hall, and was twice married, the offspring of the first union, with
Mabill, daughter of Richard Botiler, being two daughters; and of
the second, with Eleanor Kirkby, of Rawcliffe, a son and heir,
named William, who succeeded him at his death in 1512.
William Westby, although the lawful holder of the estates, did
not obtain control over them until after 1517, being a minor at
that date. He married Elizabeth Rigmayden, of Wedacer, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
had issue—John, Elizabeth, and Helen. John Westby, the heir,
had possession of Mowbreck, and Burn in Thornton township,
about the year 1556, after the decease of his father; his places of
residence were Mowbreck and Burn Halls. He was thrice married,
and by his last wife, Ann, daughter of Sir Richard Molyneux, of
Sefton and Larbrick, and widow of Thomas Dalton, of Thurnham,
had issue—John, Thomas, William, Ellen, and Mary. John
Westby succeeded his father in 1591, and dying unmarried in
1604, was in his turn succeeded by his brother, Thomas Westby,
who was twice married, and purchased the estate of Whitehall,
where the children of his second union established themselves.
The offspring of his first wife, Perpetua, daughter of Edward
Norris, of Speke, were—John, Thomas, Edward, William,
Francis, Margaret, Perpetua, and Anne. John Westby, the
heir, came into the Mowbreck estate and Burn Hall some time
after 1622, but dying without issue in 1661, was succeeded by his
nephew, Thomas, the eldest son of his fourth brother, Francis
Westby, Thomas Westby, M.D., slain in the civil wars, and his
two other brothers, Edward and William, having died childless.
Thomas Westby, the inheritor of Westby, Mowbreck, and Burn,
was born in 1641, and espoused Bridget, daughter of Thomas
Clifton, of Lytham Hall, his issue being John, Thomas, William,
Cuthbert, Robert, Francis, Bridget, Anne, and Dorothy. John
Westby, the eldest son, inherited Westby, Mowbreck, and Burn
Hall, on the demise of his father in 1700. Thomas Tyldesley, of
Fox Hall, was intimate with this gentleman, as observed from the
following entry in his diary in the year 1715:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“June primo.—Went to Mains to prayers; thence with Jack Westby to Burn
to dinner; stayed till 4; thence to Whinneyheys; stayed till 9; soe home.”</p>

</div>

<p>John Westby married, in 1688, Jane, daughter of Christopher
Parker, of Bradkirk Hall, and had issue four daughters—Catherine,
who married Alexander Osbaldeston, of Sunderland;
Bridget, the wife of William Shuttleworth, of Turnover Hall;
Mary, the wife of the Rev. Thomas Alderson; and Anne, the
wife of the Rev. J. Bennison, of London. At the death of John
Westby in 1722, Burn Hall and estate passed to the Bennisons,
whilst Mowbreck became the property of Thomas Westby, who
died childless six years later, and afterwards of Robert Westby,
brothers of the deceased John Westby. Margaret Shuttleworth,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
the daughter of William and Bridget Shuttleworth, of Turnover,
married her cousin, Thomas Westby, of Whitehall, in 1744, and
had numerous offspring, the eldest of whom, John Westby,
succeeded to Mowbreck, as heir-at-law, on the death of his
relative, Robert Westby, before mentioned, in 1762. This John
Westby died in 1811 unmarried, and was succeeded by his only
surviving brother, Thomas Westby. This gentleman also died
unmarried, and was succeeded in 1829 in the Turnover Hall
estate, by his cousin, Thomas Westby, heir-at-law, to whose
eldest son, George Westby, he left Whitehall and Mowbreck.
George Westby espoused Mary Pauton, the eldest daughter of
Major John Tate, of the 6th West Indian Infantry, and had issue—Mary
Virginia Ann; Matilda Julia, wife of the Rev. Dr. Henry
Hayman; Jocelyn Tate; Ada Perpetua; Georgina Blanche;
Ashley George, late captain in the army; Cuthbert Menzies;
Bernard Hægar, captain 16th regiment; Basil Clifton, captain
16th regiment. George Westby died at Paris in 1842, and was
succeeded by his eldest son, Jocelyn Tate, the present holder,
who took by royal license the name and arms of Fazakerley on
espousing, in 1862, Matilda Harriette Gillibrand-Fazakerley sister
and co-heiress of the late Henry Hawarden Gillibrand-Fazakerley,
the son of Henry Hawarden Fazakerley, of Gillibrand Hall, etc.,
and lord of the manor of Chorley.</p>

<p>Jocelyn Tate Fazakerley-Westby, of Mowbreck Hall, esq., was
formerly a cornet in the Scotch Greys, and is now a captain of
Lancashire hussars, yeomanry cavalry. He is a justice of the
peace and a deputy-lieutenant of the county of Lancaster.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">The ancient town and port of Poulton occupies the
summit of a gentle ascent about one mile removed
from the waters of Wyre at Skippool, and three
from the Irish Sea at Blackpool. Between 1080 and
’86, Poltun, as it was written in the Norman Survey, contained no
more than two carucates of land under tillage, or in an arable
condition, so that out of the 900 acres composing the township,
only 200 were cultivated by the inhabitants. A considerable
proportion of the entire area of the township, however, would be
covered with lofty trees, and provide excellent forage ground for
large herds of swine, which formed the chief live-stock dealt in by
our Anglo-Saxon and early Norman ancestors. Taking this into
consideration, the comparatively small amount of soil devoted to
agriculture, may not, indeed, indicate so meagre a population
about the close of the eleventh century as otherwise it would
seem to do, but still the evidence adduced is barely sufficient
whereon to base the assumption that the antecedents of Poulton
had been less under the destructive influence of the Danes than
those of its neighbours. Regarding the locality more retrospectively,
and turning back, for a brief space, to the era of the Romans,
it must be admitted that nothing has as yet been discovered
which could be construed into an intimation that the followers of
Agricola, or their descendants, ever had a settlement or encampment
on the site. It is true that the churchyard has yielded up
many specimens of their ancient coinage, whilst others have been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
found at no great distance, but the character of the relics is in no
way suggestive of a sojournment, like that of the fragmentary
domestic utensils and urns of Kirkham; and when it is remembered
that the much-used Roman road (Dane’s Pad) leading to
the most important harbour of the west coast, passed through
the vicinity on its way towards the Warren of Rossall, the
explanation of the presence of the coins, as of other antiquities
along its line, is obvious. The name of the town and district
now under examination is of pure Anglo-Saxon origin, and
acquired from its proximity to the pool of the Skipton, or
Skippool, the signification of the word being, it is scarcely
necessary to add, the enclosure or township of the pool. The
date at which habitations first became visible on the soil must
remain in a great measure a matter of conjecture, as the annals
of history are silent respecting this and most other towns of
Amounderness, until the arrival of William the Conqueror, but
we may safely infer that it was not long after the advent of the
Saxons before a situation so convenient both to the stream of
Wyre and the frequented pathway just mentioned, attracted a
small colony of settlers. Whatever century gave birth to
Poulton, it is certain that from such epoch to 1066, the
population would be constituted, almost exclusively, of the
class known as “Villani,” perhaps most appropriately interpreted
by our term villagers, and that the occupation of
these bondsmen of the soil would be the tillage of the land
and the superintendence of swine. Their huts were doubtless
of very rude and primitive construction, but somewhere
within the boundaries of the township there must have been a
dwelling of more pretentious exterior, the residence of the Town-Reve,
who received the dues and tolls from the “Villani,” on
behalf of the large territorial lord, and exercised a general supervision
over them. Athelstan appears to have held the lordship of
the whole of Amounderness in 936, when he conveyed it to the
See of York, and possibly before he ascended the throne it was
invested successively in his regal predecessors.</p>

<p>After the Conquest, Poulton passed into the possession of the
Norman nobleman, Roger de Poictou, by whom it was granted in
1094, to the priory of St. Mary, at Lancaster. “He gave,” says
the charter, “Poltun in Agmundernesia, and whatsoever belonged<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
to it, and the church with one carucate of land, and all other
things belonging to it; moreover he gave the tithe of venison
and of pawnage<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> in all the woods, and the tithe of his fishery.”<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
This extract proves beyond question the existence of a church at
Poulton exactly eight years after the completion of the Domesday
record; and further, that it was endowed with one carucate of
land, or half the cultivated portion of the township. At the first
glance it seems more probable that the sacred edifice was overlooked
by the investigators in the course of the survey than that
it was erected so shortly afterwards, but a study of other pages of
the register betrays such evident care and minuteness on the part
of those to whom the work of compilation was entrusted, that it
appears impossible for an important building like the church to
have escaped their notice. Roger de Poictou was justly celebrated
for zeal in the cause of his faith; several monastic institutions
owed their establishment to his liberality, and amongst them was
St. Mary’s of Lancaster. It will therefore be but a reasonable
conclusion to arrive at, that he built and endowed the parish
church of Poulton with the intention of presenting it to the
Priory of his own founding, in connection with the abbey of
Sees in Normandy. During the reign of Richard I. (1189-99),
Theobald Walter quitclaimed to the abbot of Sees all his right to
the advowson of Poulton and the church of Bispham, owing to a
suit instituted against him by that ecclesiastic;<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> and hence it
must be inferred that the donation of Roger de Poictou had
through some cause reverted to him, being subsequently conferred
on Walter in company with other of the confiscated estates of the
rebellious baron. The abbot of Cockersand also had some
interest in the town about the time the last event took place, and
in about 1216 he compounded with the prior of Lancaster for
certain tithes held by him in the parish.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> In 1246 the mediety of
the church of Poulton and the chapel of Bispham was granted
by the archdeacon of Richmond to the priory of St. Mary, and
half a century later John Romanus, archdeacon of Richmond,
confirmed the gift, bestowing on it in addition the remaining<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
mediety, to be received when death had removed the present
holder. A clause in the document stipulated that immediately
the second mediety had been appropriated a vicar should be
appointed at a salary of twenty marks (£13 6s. 8d.) per annum.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
Here again it is clear that some time in the interval between
1199 and 1246 the lands and living of Poulton had once more
been forfeited or disposed of by the Lancaster monastery, but in
the absence of any records bearing on the subject, the manner
and reason of the relinquishment must still continue enveloped
in a veil of mystery. From 1246 the vicarage of Poulton
remained attached to the Lancaster foundation until the
dissolution of alien priories, when it was conveyed to the abbey
of Sion, in Middlesex, and retained by that convent up to the
time of the Reformation in 1536. Alien priories, it may be
explained, were small monastic institutions connected with the
abbeys of Normandy, and established on lands which had been
granted or bequeathed to the parent houses by William the
Conqueror or one of his followers. They were occupied by only
a very limited number of brethren and members of the sisterhood.
A prior was appointed over each, his chief duty being to
collect the rents and other monies due from their estates, etc.,
and transmit them over to Normandy. Such immense sums
were in that way annually exported out of the country, that it
was ultimately deemed expedient by the king and his ministers to
suppress all priories of this description.</p>

<p>The Banastres were a family long connected with the Fylde
through landed property which they held in the neighbourhood;
originally they are stated to have come over from Normandy with
William the Conqueror, and to have settled at Newton in the
Willows. On their frequent journeys to and from Thornton,
Singleton, and Staining, the tenants of the priory of St. Mary
were in the habit of crossing over the lands of the Banastres,
by whom their intrusions were deeply resented, which led
to constant feuds between them and the head of the Lancaster
monastery. In 1276, as we learn from the “Regist. S.
Mariæ de Lanc.,” Sir Adam Banastre with several of his friends
and retainers, amongst whom were John Wenne, Richard le<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
Demande (the collector), William de Thorneton, Richard de
Brockholes, Geoffrey le Procuratoure (the proctor), and Adam le
Reve (the reeve), attacked the prior, Ralph de Truno, and his
train of attendants, when on their way to Poulton. They seized
and carried off both him and his retinue to Thornton, where, after
treating them with great indignity, they chastised and imprisoned
them. Edward I., on hearing of the disgraceful outrage, appointed
John Travers, William de Tatham, and John de Horneby to
investigate the matter and ascertain the cause, if possible; but no
paper is now to be found revealing the result of the examination
or hinting at the provocation, although a surmise may be hazarded
that it was no new quarrel, but simply the old feud, which had at
last culminated in a cowardly assault on a defenseless ecclesiastic.</p>

<p>In 1299, Poulton was held in trust by Thomas, earl of Lancaster,
for the prior of St. Mary; and eight years anterior to that date
the abbot of Deulacres, in Staffordshire, drew certain revenues
from land in the township, viz., £8 per annum from 16 carucates
of land, about 13s. 4d. each year from the sale of meadow land,
10s. from assessed rents, and £5 from the profit of stock, making
in all an annual total of £14 3s. 4d. The repeated disputes
between Sir Adam Banastre and Adam Conrates, prior of
Lancaster, relative to the trespasses of the latter’s tenants and the
collection of tithes on the domains of the former were peaceably
settled in 1330, by an arrangement, in which Sir Adam pledged
himself to allow two good roads across his lands—one from
Poulton and Thornton to Skippool and thence across the ford of
Aldwath, now called Shard, on to Singleton, the other starting
from the same localities and running to the ford of Bulk higher
up the river, probably the modern Cartford, or in its vicinity; in
addition the knight agreed to make good any damage that the
prior or his dependants might suffer over that portion of their
journeys.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> Adam Conrates on his side promised to withdraw all
actions for trespass, etc., on the fulfilment of these conditions. In
1354 a person named Robert de Pulton held some small possessions
in Poulton, but nothing further than that trifling fact is recorded
about him, although it is probable from the orthography of his
name that his ancestors were at some time closely and honourably<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
associated with the town from which their distinctive appellation
appears to have been derived. During the time of Elizabeth,
James Massey, gentleman, of Carleton and Layton, purchased
from the governors of the Savoy Hospital, in London, the tolls
in the parish of Poulton, together with all the “chauntry and
appurtenances” founded in the parish church of Bricksworth, and
all messuages, lands, tenements, etc., situated in the town and
parish of Poulton; the tolls remained subject to an annual
rent of £2, to be paid on St. Michael’s day to the governors
and chaplains of the hospital. Later in the same reign James
Massey sold to William Leigh, esq., of High Leigh, in Cheshire,
half of these tolls and some pasture fields, called “Angell’s Holme,”
adjoining the Horse-bridge, where in earlier days, when the waters
of Wyre made their way along a brook into the interior of this
neighbourhood, boats are said to have been built. The Rigbys, of
Layton Hall, subsequently became possessed of a great part of
Poulton, and at the present day a large number of houses are
leased in their name for the remainder of terms of 999 years; the
Heskeths, of Mains, and other leading families in the district were
also considerable property owners in the town. On one occasion
the ruling powers of Kirkham made an unsuccessful attempt to
obtain the tolls arising from the cattle fairs held in Poulton and
Singleton, but on what plea such claims were urged the record is
silent.</p>

<p>In an entry which occurs in the lists of the Norman Roll, an
impost consisting of the ninth of corn, fleeces, and lambs, and
created in 9 Edward III., 1336, it is stated that in 1291 the
vicarage of Poulton was taxed by Pope Nicholas at 10 marks, or
£6 13s. 4d. modern coinage, the prior of Norton taking £2 in
garbs or wheat sheaves. Afterwards the vicarage was freed from
the payments of tenths on account of the smallness of the living.
Dr. Whittaker informs us that the priory of Lancaster was granted
by Henry V., in 1422, to the chancellor of England, who in that
year instituted a vicar to the living of Poulton, but eight years
previously, in the same reign, the priory was granted in trust for
the abbess and convent of Sion; from which seemingly contradictory
statements it may be gathered that the chancellor was
the trustee for the property, and in such capacity alone acted as
patron of the church of Poulton. In support of this supposition<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
may be cited the fact that the Lancaster house and its belongings
were not received by the convent in Middlesex until 1431, during
the sovereignty of Henry VI., when the vicarage was endowed by
the abbess, and William de Croukeshagh presented to the living.
This pastor, the earliest personally mentioned, was succeeded on
his death, in 1442, by Richard Brown, appointed by the same
convent. “Among the records,” writes Baines in his history of
Lancashire, “in the Augmentation Office is in indenture tripartite
in English, bearing the date 11 Henry VIII., 1579, and purporting
to be made between the Abbess of Sion on the first part, Thomas
Singleton and Henry Singleton on the second part, and William
Bretherton, vicar of Poulton, on the third part, by which the
tithe-sheaf of Pulton and a tenement are leased to the vicar, that
he may better keep and maintain his house in Pulton; the term
to continue during the existence of a lease granted to the persons
named Singleton by Sion abbey.” At the Reformation the manor
and advowson were claimed by the crown, and a few years later
became the property of the Fleetwoods. The last royal presentation
to the living was made by Edward VI. in 1552, just one year
before his death, whilst the first by this family was in 1565, by
John Fleetwood, lord of the manor of Penwortham. The Rev.
Charles Hesketh, M.A., of North Meols, is now the patron.</p>

<p>The ancient church of Poulton stood on the site now occupied
by the existing edifice, and like it, was dedicated to the Saxon
St. Chad or Cheadda, bishop of Mercia, and seated at Chester in
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 669. The original structure consisted of only a nave and
north aisle, the outer walls of which were composed of sandstone,
whilst the double roof rested on semicircular arches, extending
from the chancel to the font, and supported on four octagonal
pillars. These semicircular arches belonged to a very antique
style of architecture, and have given rise to the belief that the
pillars were at first massive cylinders, being carved into an
angular form about the time of Henry VIII. The pulpit had its
place towards the south, and at the east end there appears to have
been a small gallery. A pipe clay monument <i>in memoriam</i> of
the Singletons, of Staining, stood inside the church, but was,
intentionally or accidentally, destroyed when the building was
pulled down. A rude brass crucifix and a chalice, both of which
belonged to the church previous to the Reformation, are still<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
preserved, one being in the possession of a late priest at Breck
chapel, and the other in the Catholic chapel at Claughton. The
upper halves of the windows, including the east one, were semicircular
in form. In 1622 the old chancel was repaired by the
Rev. Peter Whyte, the vicar, and a stone, two feet in length and
one foot and a half in depth, bearing the name “Peter Whyte,”
and the date “1622,” in raised letters about six inches long,
was placed over the east window. This piece of masonry now
occupies a situation in the south-west corner of the edifice. The
churchyard, which is reported to have been usually in a filthy
and disgraceful state, was partly surrounded by a moderately wide
ditch, on the brink of which three or four fine sycamore trees
flourished, but were cut down when sundry alterations and
improvements were effected in the ground. In 1751, after the
old church had been standing six centuries and a half, it was
determined to demolish it, and erect a more commodious building
on the site. The tower, however, was retained, as, being of more
recent date, it evinced none of those symptoms of decay which
had rendered the body of the edifice dangerous to worshippers.
An opinion prevails that the tower was built about the time of
Charles I., and such a view is upheld by the discovery on the
removal of the pulpit in 1836 of a square stone, having on its face
the raised letters TB. WG. in the first line, IH. TG. IH. in the
second line, and WG. 1638 in the last line. It is supposed that
this stone, which is now fixed in the wall at the south-west
corner of the church, was carved in commemoration of the
erection of the tower, and the raised letters are the initials of the
churchwardens then in office, and the date when the work was
accomplished. Between this stone and the one previously referred
to, there is a stained-glass memorial window to “Robert Buck,
born 1805, died 1862, presented by his sister, C. D. Foxton.”
Mrs. Catherine Dauntesy Foxton, the lady here indicated, is the
representative of the family of Bucks, of Agecroft Hall, Pendlebury,
and inherited considerable property in the neighbourhood
of Poulton. During the time the new church was in course of
building, divine service was performed in the tithe-barn, and the
ceremony of baptism at the residences of the parents. The funds
required for carrying out the important undertaking were
doubtless chiefly supplied through the munificence of a comparatively<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
small circle of private individuals, whose contributions
would probably be in some measure supplemented by minor
collections amongst the less opulent agriculturists and peasantry.
One person, named Welsh, who resided at Marton, seems to have
cherished a bitter antipathy to the levelling of ancient structures
in general, and embodied his refusal to assist this particular work
in the following rhymes:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“While here on earth I do abide,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I’ll keep up walls and pull down pride;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To build anew I’ll ne’er consent,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And make the needy poor lament.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It has usually been affirmed that the side galleries were not
erected until several years after the new church had been finished,
but the annexed extract from an old document discovered in
1875, shows that authority to build them was obtained in 1751,
whilst the church was levelled with the ground; and as the parchment
also discloses that a number of seats in these galleries were
allotted to certain gentlemen of the parish in the ensuing year,
there is ample evidence that the rebuilding of the church and
their erection were carried on simultaneously:—“25 June, 1751.
On the Certificate and request of Roger Hesketh, Esq., Patron;
the Rev. Robert Loxham, Clerk, Vicar; and the Churchwardens
of the Parish Church of Poulton; a Faculty was Granted to
John Bird, John Birley, and Richard Tennant, all of Poulton,
Gentlemen (for the better uniformity of the Parish Church of
Poulton, which was then taken down and rebuilding) to take
down the Gallery over the Chancel in the East of the said
Church, which was then very irregular and incommodious, and
to rebuild the same with a convenient staircase, stairs, and
passage leading thereto, of their own expense, in the west end
thereof to adjoin to the north side of the gallery there then
standing, and to be made uniform therewith, and to make
satisfaction to the several owners of the seats in the said Gallery
for the damage sustained in removing the same and altering, and
lessening the seats therein; and to erect a Gallery on each side of
the said Church, with convenient staircases leading thereto at the
north-east and south-east ends of the said Church, if necessary,
according to the form of the said Certificate annexed, and also
to remove the Pulpit and reading desk from the place where the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
same then lately stood, near to the place where the Churchwardens’
seat was then lately situate, as it would greatly tend to the
conformity of the said Church and to the benefit and advantage
of the Inhabitants of the said Parish, and also that they might
have liberty to sell and dispose of the seats to be contained in the
said intended side Galleries, to such persons within the said
Parish as should stand most in need thereof, to reimburse themselves
the charges and expenses they would be necessarily put to in
building the said intended galleries and making the alterations
aforesaid.”</p>

<p>The present edifice is of stone, plain but commodious, and
comprises a chancel, body, and embattled tower, with buttresses
supporting each corner. Formerly a small shed stood on one
side of the tower, and was used as a repository for the sculls and
other osseous relics of humanity, which were unearthed during
the process of making fresh graves; this house was pulled down
some years ago, and its numerous treasures returned to the ground
at the south-east corner of the yard. The chancel now standing
was erected eight years since, mainly through the exertions of the
Rev. Thomas Clarke, M.A., the vicar, who died in 1869. On the
exterior of the building, over a door at the south-east corner of
the body is the inscription:—“Insignia Rici Fleetwood Ari Hujus
Eccliæ Patroni Ann Dni 1699”; above which is a circumscribed
uneven space formerly occupied by the arms of the Fleetwood
family. Within the church the quarterings of the Heskeths and
Fleetwoods are hung against the walls in frames. At the west
end of the building there is a wooden panel into which the
following names have been cut:—</p>

<ul class="smaller">
<li>Rich. Dickson.</li>
<li>Rich. Willson.</li>
<li>John Hull.</li>
<li>Rich. Willson.</li>
<li>John Woodhouse, churchwardens, 1730.</li>
</ul>

<p>From the way in which the holders of similar offices are
arranged at present it is surmised that these gentlemen respectively
represented the townships of</p>

<ul class="smaller">
<li>Poulton.</li>
<li>Carleton.</li>
<li>Hardhorn.</li>
<li>Thornton.</li>
<li>Marton.</li>
</ul>

<p>On the south side of the church is a mural tablet to the memory
of the Rev. Richard Buck, M.A., of Agecroft Hall, Pendlebury,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
born 1761, died 1845, also Margaret, his wife, and Margaret, his
daughter. Another monument bears the names of Frances Hull,
born 1794, died 1847; William Wilson Hull, born 1822, died
1847, in the Queen’s service, at Bathurst, St. Mary’s Island in the
river Gambia; Henry Mitchell Hull, M.A., born 1827, died 1853;
John Hull, M.D., born 1761, died 1843—“left the eldest of the
three children of John Hull, surgeon; an orphan at six years of
age, poor, friendless, by the best use of all means of education
within his power, by unwearied industry, by constant self-denial,
he duly qualified himself for the practice of his profession<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>”;
Sarah Hull, died 1842; William Winstanley Hull, M.A., Fellow
of Brazenose College, Oxford, and Barrister-at-Law, eldest son
of John Hull, M.D., F.L.S., born 1784, died 1873. Here also was
the old churchwardens’ pew, removed in 1876, having a brass
plate inscribed thus:—“Thomas Whiteside, Jno Wilkinson, Jno
Whiteside, Thos. Cornwhite, Jno Hodgson, Churchwardens,
1737”; also the old pew formerly belonging to the Rigbys of
Layton Hall, on the door of which are carved the letters “A.R.,”
a goats head, and the date “1636,” being the initials and crest of
Sir Alexander Rigby, of Layton Hall. Until last year, when they
were removed to afford space for more modern seats, the two
family pews of the Fleetwoods and Heskeths stood on this side.
The pews were walled in laterally and in front by a high ornamental
railing of oak, and in the larger of the two traces of a
crest were visible on the wall. Near this spot there are many very
ancient pews, one of which has the date and initials “17.TW.02”
carved upon it, whilst on the floor of the aisle close at hand is the
gravestone of “Edward Sherdley, gentleman, dyed 21st September,
1744, aged 71,” and almost adjoining lies another stone, surmounting
the remains of Geoffrey Hornby, who died in 1732.
On the day of the latter gentleman’s funeral the west side of the
market-place was destroyed by fire, and as the procession passed
the scarves of the mourners were scorched by sparks driven by a
high wind in showers from the conflagration. On the north side<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
of the church is a pew bearing the date ‘1662’; and near to are
the old pews of Burn Hall, Little Poulton Hall, Mains Hall, and
Todderstaff Hall, above which, fastened to the wall and marking
the resting place of several members of his family, are the arms
of Thomas Fitzherbert Brockholes, esq., of Claughton, the lord of
Little Poulton, etc.</p>

<p>The chancel contains a monument in memory of Bold Fleetwood
Hesketh, died 1819, and his nephew, Edward Thomas Hesketh,
died 1820; also of Fleetwood Hesketh, of Rossall, who died in
1769, aged 30, and Frances Hesketh, who died in 1809, aged 74,
all of whom were interred beneath the Communion. In addition
there are two recent tablets, one being to the memory of the
late Thomas Clarke, vicar of the parish; and the other in memory
of Francis Wm. Conry, only child of F. A. Macfaddin, surgeon,
47th regt. Within the Communion rails are two antique and
elaborately carved oak chairs.</p>

<p>In the south gallery are mural tablets inscribed in remembrance
of Edward Hornby, died in 1766, and Margaret, his wife; Edward
Sherdley, died 1744, and Ellen, his wife; Giles Thornber, J.P.,
died 1860, and his wife; Geoffrey Hornby, died in 1732, and
Susannah, his wife; Richard Harrison, vicar of Poulton, died in
1718, aged 65; and Christopher Albin, curate of Bispham, died
in 1753, aged 56, on a pew door opposite to which is a brass plate
engraved:—“Introite et orate, cælo supinas si tuleris manus
sacra feceris, malaque effugies.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> Christopher and Margery Albin
1752.”</p>

<p>At one time a sounding board was suspended over the pulpit.
An ancient font, formerly belonging to the church and now the
property of the vicar, the Rev. William Richardson, M.A., has
carved upon its exterior the date 1649, the letters M.H., a cross,
and something, in its damaged state difficult to trace but
betraying some resemblance to a crown. The successor to this
font was removed several years since to make room for a new one
presented by the daughter of the Rev. Canon Hull, of Eaglescliffe,
in memory of her sister Frances Mary Hull, who died in 1866,
aged 20 years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span></p>

<p>The old church books, extracts from which will be given
subsequently, contain many entries of sums paid for rushes to
strew the pews and aisles, a custom existing here as late as 1813.
In the tower is a peal of six bells, with the inscriptions:—</p>

<p>The 6th bell was recast by G. Mears and Company, of London,
in 1865, at the sole expense of the Rev. T. Clarke, and is inscribed:—“T.
Clarke, M.A., vicar; W. Gaulter, J. T. Bailey, W. Jolly,
J. Whiteside, churchwardens.” The original inscription was—“Robert
Fishwick, John Wilkinson, William Cookson, James
Hull, John Moore, churchwardens.”</p>

<p>About thirty years since the roof of the church was altered and
renewed. Notwithstanding the fact that the churchyard has been
in constant use for so many centuries very few emblems of
antiquity, beyond occasional coins of the Roman era, have ever
been discovered in it, and at present, unlike most burial grounds
of great age, no specimens of raised letters are to be seen amongst
the numerous gravestones, the oldest of which still legible,
intimates the resting place of Richard Elston, and has the date
1719. At a short distance, and assisting to flag a side pathway to
the south of the church, is another stone, covering the grave of
“Richard Brown, of Great Marton, who died the third day of
April, 1723”; but neither this nor the foregoing one have any
interest beyond their antiquity. The ancient practice of tolling
the Curfew-bell is still continued in the winter evenings from
the 29th of September to the 10th of March, whilst a pancake bell
is rung at 12 o’clock on each Shrove Tuesday.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>Of the earlier vicars mentioned above, nothing is known until
we come to the Rev. Peter Whyte, of whose immediate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
descendants it is recorded that, after his death, they rapidly
drifted into poverty, and that one of them, a granddaughter,
regularly attended the fairs of Poulton as the wife of a pedlar or
hawker. The Rev. Richard Harrison was cousin to Cuthbert
Harrison, the Nonconformist divine who suffered ejection, and
belonged to the Bankfield family. Until instituted to Poulton,
Richard Harrison was curate at Goosnargh. His son Paul gained
some celebrity as a controversial writer on matters of ecclesiastical
interest.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> The Loxhams settled at Dowbridge, near Kirkham,
and that estate is still held by the family. The Rev. Thomas
Turner purchased the living in 1770, when it was worth no more
than £75 per annum, for £200, and held it until his death forty
years later. The Rev. C. Hesketh, M.A., brother to the late Sir
Peter Hesketh Fleetwood, bart., is rector of North Meols and
patron of the living. During a portion of the time when he
was vicar of Poulton, the Rev. R. Bowness was curate in charge.
The Rev. John Hull, M.A., is honorary canon of Manchester, and
was examining chaplain to the Right Rev. Prince Lee, D.D.,
the first bishop of this diocese, by whom he was appointed to the
rectory of Eaglescliffe, near Yarm, one of the most valuable livings
in his gift. The Rev. Thomas Clarke, M.A., was originally curate
at the Parish Church of Preston, and afterwards became incumbent
of Christ Church in the same town, which living he resigned
on being presented to the vicarage of Poulton.</p>

<p>Anterior to 1674 the old vicarage was a thatched building of
two stories, the upper one being open to the roof and supported
on crooks, but about that date the vicar, the Rev. Rich. Harrison,
made an addition, abutting the west end, and put the original
portion in thorough repair. This house, which was surrounded
by venerable trees, was taken down in 1835, and the present
vicarage erected on the site.</p>

<p>In 1830, a spacious building, capable of holding three hundred
persons, was erected in Sheaf Street by voluntary subscription for
the purposes of a Sunday School, previous to which a small
cottage in the Green had been used as a meeting place for the
scholars connected with the church.</p>

<p>About one hundred and fifty years ago the town of Poulton
presented a very different appearance to that it wears in our day.
The market-place was surrounded by a number of low thatched
houses of very humble exteriors, if we except a few private
residences, as those of the Walmsleys and Rigbys, which stood
out conspicuously from the rest, not only by their superiority in
size, but also by the possession of slated or flagged roofs. The
house of the Rigbys was built in 1693 by Sir Alexander Rigby, of
Layton Hall, who was High-sheriff of the county in 1691-2, and
stands at the south end of the square, the family arms and date
of erection being still attached to the front wall. The building is
now used as a dwelling and retail shop combined, and contains
little of moment beyond the ancient oak balustrade and staircase.
It is probable that Sir Alexander Rigby built the house with the
intention of using it as a town residence for himself and family
during the winter months, for we must remember that Poulton
contained several persons of note and distinction at that time,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
and nothing is more natural than that the knight should prefer
the cheerful society to be found amongst them to the long
solitudes of the Hall during the dull, inclement season of the
year, when country roads were almost impassable. After Sir
Alexander Rigby had been released from prison, having satisfied
the claims of his creditors, he took up his abode permanently in
Poulton until his death, Layton Hall and other property having
been sold, but whether his remains were laid in the churchyard
here, or removed elsewhere, cannot be ascertained.</p>

<p>At the opposite end of the market-place was the Moot Hall,
connected with which were shambles and pent-houses, the latter
being continued along the fronts of the dwellings in the square.
None of the streets could boast a pavement, and as a consequence
intercourse between the inhabitants in rainy weather was a matter
of considerable inconvenience and difficulty, visiting under such
unfavourable circumstances being usually performed by means of
stepping stones. Public lamps were unknown in the streets, and
any one whose business or pleasure took him abroad after night-fall
or dusk, would have to rely on the feeble glimmer of a horn
lantern to guide him along the proper track and protect him
from floundering in the mud. Looking on this picture of discomfort,
it seems pretty certain to us that our Poultonian forefathers
at least, could they but enjoy one week of our modern life and
improvements, would be the very last to join in the wish, so often
enthusiastically, but rather thoughtlessly, expressed, for a revival
of the <i>good</i> old times. The market-square still retains its fishstones,
cross, whipping post, and stocks; and although the wooden
portion of the last has been recently renewed, we are in a position
to inform the curious or alarmed reader that it has not been done
with the view of re-introducing the obsolete punishment, but
merely to preserve a link, be it ever so painful an one, with the
past. The cross surmounts a stone pillar placed on a circular
base of similar material, formed in steps and tapering towards the
column.</p>

<p>Although Poulton was never the scene of any military
encounter during the unsettled eras of our history, still there
is ample proof that the inhabitants were far from lethargic or
indifferent to the course of events during those times. During
the reign of Henry VIII., when James IV. of Scotland succumbed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
to the superiority of the English arms, and yielded up his life on
Flodden Field, the yeomanry and husbandmen of this town were
well represented; and the cheerful alacrity with which they
hastened to join the royal standard under Lord Stanley, in
company with others from the Fylde, between here and Preston,
is lauded in an ancient ballad, written to celebrate the victory,
from which the following lines are extracted:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“From Ribchester unto Rachdale,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From Poulton to Preston with pikes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They with yᵉ Stanley howte forthe went.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There is no necessity to recapitulate the stirring incidents of
the Civil Wars, the bivouacking and plundering in the neighbourhood
or the frequent demands for recruits by the royal and
parliamentary generals, but it will be sufficiently convincing of
the earnestness and loyalty of the inhabitants to state, that most
of the local families of influence risked their lives and fortunes in
the service of the king, leaving little doubt that those of humbler
sphere would be actuated by a like enthusiasm.</p>

<p>About a century ago it was customary amongst the gentry and
more wealthy yeomanry to hold their interments at night by the
light of lamps or lanterns, and during the passage of the funeral
procession through the town, each householder illuminated his
windows with burning candles. The last person to be buried with
this ceremony was the Rev. Thomas Turner, the vicar, who died
in 1810.</p>

<p>Of the domestic habits of Poulton at that period, and rather
earlier, it need only be said that they presented little variation
from those of other towns or villages similarly situated; removed
from the enervating and seductive temptations of a city, and
forced, for the most part, to earn their bread under the broad
canopy of heaven, it is not surprising to find that the people were
a long-lived and vigorous race. Their feastings and merrymakings
took place at fair-times, and at such other seasons as
were universally set apart in rural districts for rejoicings and
festivity, notably harvest gatherings and the first of May, the
latter being especially honoured. On that day the causeways
were strewn with flowers, and all things suitable for the festival
were lavishly provided; wine, ale, and sweetmeats being freely
contributed by the gentry and others. The peasantry were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
clothed in sober suits of hodden grey, the productions of the
“disty and wharl” or spinning wheel, without which no household
was considered complete, whilst their food was of the plainest
kind, consisting mostly of barley and rye bread, with boiled
parsnips and peas eaten in the pod, wheaten bread being reserved
for the consumption of the more wealthy classes. The present
station at the Breck, a name of Danish origin, and signifying an
acclivity, stands either on, or in close proximity to, the site of the
old ducking-pond, or rather brook, where the scolds of Poulton
were wont in former days to have the</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">“Venom of their spleen”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">copiously diluted and cooled by frequent immersions.</p>

<p>A native of Poulton thus wrote of the town more than fifty
years since, and if the present generation but emulates the virtues
of its forefathers as herein stated, there are many places which
would form, notwithstanding its protracted inertitia, less agreeable
homes than the ancient metropolis of the Fylde:—</p>

<p>Sixty years since Poulton contained a manufactory for sacking,
sail-cloth, and sheeting, belonging to a Mr. Harrison, who lived
in the house now in the occupation of R. Dunderdale, esq., J.P.,
and had his weaving shed at the rear of those premises. That
gentleman employed from thirty to forty hands regularly during
the time he conducted the business—a period of about fifteen
years. An establishment connected with flax dressing and twine
spinning, and employing several hands, was located in the house
erected by Sir Alexander Rigby, of Layton; and a currier and
leather dresser had his works in Church Street. Of other trades
and professions in the town at that date, there were four attorneys,
two surgeons, seven butchers, nine bakers and flour dealers, three
wine and spirit merchants, two maltsters, ten boot and shoe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
makers, five linen and woollen drapers, four tailors, three milliners,
four grocers, three ironmongers, three joiners, two wheelwrights,
two coopers, two painters, three plumbers and glaziers,
and two corn-millers. Subsequently Harrison’s residence was
used for parochial purposes, and formed the town’s workhouse
until the bill of Sir Robert Peel brought about the joint system
of pauper relief and management under the name of Unions;
and at one time small looms were placed in the old shed behind
the workhouse, for the purpose of providing remunerative occupation
for some of the inmates. Three fairs are held annually for
cattle and cloth, and take place on the 3rd of February, the 13th
of April, and the 3rd of November, whilst a general market, but
very indifferently, if at all, attended, is appointed to be held each
Monday. About the year 1840, when the Preston and Wyre
Railway was completed and the Poulton Station erected, a dye-house
of some considerable size, and one that had done a large
business in the Fylde for many years, was taken down, and shortly
afterwards the Royal Oak Hotel built on its site. About the
same time the old brook, over which the cuckstool hung in earlier
days, and whose waters had long been polluted by discharges from
the dye-house, was arched over with brick and earth, and included
in the station premises. The Railway Hotel was erected a little
anterior to the inn just mentioned. The other hotels of Poulton,
situated in the town itself, are ancient, and by their size and number,
considering the smallness of the present population, are indicative
of the former importance of its market and fairs, and intimate
that its position as the centre of a wide district was the means of
exciting and maintaining a large amount of commercial activity,
such as would necessitate the frequent visits of business agents
and others. Several private houses can be pointed out as having
been in earlier days places of public entertainment, amongst
which may be named one now used as a bakery and bread shop
in Queen’s Square, and which formerly bore the name of the
Spread Eagle Hotel; in Sheaf Street, also, there existed about
half a century ago a small but respectable hotel, called the Wheat
Sheaf Inn, with bowling green attached, but like other more
pretentious establishments, it has been converted into a dwelling-house,
whilst a handsome residence occupies the old bowling
green.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span></p>

<p>The Independents were the first section of the Dissenting
community to erect a chapel for their members, which they
accomplished in 1808. After being in use twenty or thirty years,
this place of worship was closed, and not re-opened until about
ten years since. In 1819 a chapel was erected by the Wesleyans
in Back Street, and in 1861 the building was enlarged. At the
Breck there is a Roman Catholic chapel, which stands back some
distance from the road leading to Skippool, and is approached by
a long avenue of trees. The chapel is a plain brick building, with
three unstained windows on each side; and above the entrance
has been placed a square stone inscribed with a verse from the
Psalms—“I have loved, O Lord, the beauty of thy House, and
the place where thy Glory dwelleth,”—and the date of erection,
“<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1813.” Within the edifice the pews are open and arranged
in three rows, one running down each side, and a double set
occupying the central portion of the body. The solitary gallery
at the end opposite the altar is lined with seats, and contains a
harmonium, whilst the altar itself is handsomely and suitably
decorated. The chapel is dedicated to St. John, and on the east
and south sides lies the burial ground, wherein may be seen a stone
slab carved by an eccentric character of Poulton, named James
Bailey, whose remains are now deposited beneath it. The upper
surface of the stone is ornamented with the outlines of two coffins,
recording respectively the demises of Margaret Bailey, in 1841,
and James Bailey, her father, in 1853. Between the coffins, and
severing their upper portions, is a cross, with a few words at the
foot, on each side of which are the representations of a scull and
cross-bones. Other specimens of the sculptural genius of Bailey are
lavishly, if not tastefully, scattered over the remainder of the slab.
The residence of the priest is attached to the chapel, and in
Breck Road are the elegant Gothic schools connected with it.
Until the opening, in 1868, of these schools, which have since
been extended by the erection of a wing, a loft over an outbuilding
facing the priests’ house, received the Catholic children of the
parish for educational purposes.</p>

<p>We now come to speak of Poulton as a port, and in this
respect our information, it must be acknowledged, is very scanty;
the harbours of Poulton were situated at Skippool and Wardleys,
on opposite banks of the Wyre, and it was to the cargoes imported<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
to those places that the custom-house of the town owed its
existence. At what date it was first established cannot be
discovered, but that it was in being nearly two centuries ago is
proved by a paper on “The comparative wages of public servants
in the customs,” in which the following occurs:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We find that William Jennings, collector of the customs at Poulton, in the
Fylde, received in 1708, during the reign of Queen Ann, for his yearly services
thirty pounds per annum; and five subordinate officers had seventy-five pounds
equally divided amongst them.”</p>

</div>

<p>The chief traffic of the port was in timber, imported from the
Baltic and America; and flax and tallow, which arrived from
Russia. In 1825 Poulton was described by Mr. Baines, in his
History of Lancashire, as a creek under Preston, and it is
probable that such had been its position for a long time anterior
to that date. In 1826 Poulton was made a sub-port under
Lancaster, and later, when the town of Fleetwood sprang up at
the mouth of the Wyre, the customs were removed from Poulton
to that new port.</p>

<p>Subjoined are the number of inhabitants of the township at
intervals of ten years from 1801, when the first official census was

<p>In 1770, during the reign of George III., an act of parliament
was obtained by means of which a court was established in this
town “for,” according to the wording of the deed, “the more
easy and speedy recovery of small debts within the parishes of
Poulton, Lytham, Kirkham, and Bispham, and the townships of
Preesall and Stalmine.” A number of gentlemen engaged in
commercial pursuits and residing in these several districts were
appointed commissioners, any three or more of whom constituted
a court of justice, by the name and style of The Court of Requests;
they were empowered to hear and determine all such matters of
debt as were under forty shillings, further they were authorised
and required, “to meet, assemble, and hold the said Court in each
of the said Parishes of Poulton and Kirkham, once in every week
at least, to wit, on every Monday at Poulton, and on every
Thursday at Kirkham, and oftener if there should be occasion, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
a Court-house, or some convenient place appointed in each of the
said Parishes.” Each commissioner on being elected took the
following oath:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I ... do swear That I will faithfully, impartially, and honestly, according
to the best of my Judgement, hear and determine all such Matters and Causes as
shall be brought before me, by virtue of an Act of Parliament, for the more easy
and speedy Recovery of small Debts, within the Parishes etc.; without Favour or
Affection, Prejudice or Malice, to either Party. So help me God.”</p>

</div>

<p>Edward Whiteside and Simon Russell were elected, respectively,
clerk and sergeant of this court, and James Standen, of Poulton,
in consideration of having advanced money to pay the expenses of
obtaining the act and providing suitable accommodation for its
administration, had authority given to him and his heirs to
appoint a person to be clerk or sergeant as often as either of
those offices should become vacant, until the sum so advanced
with lawful interest had been repaid; after which the appointments
were to be filled up by a majority of votes at a special
meeting of the commissioners, not less than eleven being present.
For the better regulation of the proceedings it was enacted that a
majority, amounting to five, of the commissioners assembled in
court should have full power and authority to make, as often as
occasion required, such rules and orders for the better management
of the court as might seem necessary and conducive to the
purposes of the act, provided always such rules or orders did
not abridge or alter the scale of fees as at first arranged, and were
consistent with equity and the true intent of the act. In the
event of anyone neglecting to comply with an order from this
court for the payment of money owing an execution was awarded
against the body or goods of the debtor, if the former, the
sergeant was, by a precept under the hand and seal of the clerk,
“empowered and required to take and apprehend, or cause to be
taken and apprehended, such party or parties, being within any
of the parishes or townships aforesaid, and convey him, her, or
them, to some common gaol, or house of correction, within the
county palatine of Lancaster, there to remain until he, she, or
they, had performed and obeyed such order, decree, or judgment,
so as no person should remain in confinement upon any
such execution, for any longer space of time than three months.”
In the case of goods the sergeant was similarly empowered
“to levy by distress and sale of goods, of such party, being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
within the parishes or townships aforesaid, such sum and sums
of money and costs as should be so ordered and decreed.”</p>

<p>One clause of the act stated that if any person or persons
affronted, insulted, or abused, all or any of the commissioners,
the clerk, or officers of the court, either during the sitting or in
going to or returning from the same, or interrupted the proceedings,
or obstructed the clerk or sergeant in the lawful
execution of their different offices, he, she, or they should be
brought before a justice of the peace, who was hereby empowered
to inflict on conviction a fine of not more than 40s., and not less
than 5s. The jurisdiction of the court did not extend to any debt
or rent upon any lease or contract, where the title of any lands,
tenements, or hereditaments came in question; nor to any debt
arising from any last will or testament, or matrimony, or
anything properly belonging to the ecclesiastical courts; nor to
any debt from any horse-race, cock-match, wager, or any kind
of gaming or play; nor from any forfeiture upon any penal
statute or bye-law; nor did it extend to any debt whatsoever
whereof there had not been contract, acknowledgment, undertaking,
or promise to pay within six years from the date of the
summons, although any of the above mentioned debts should
not amount to forty shillings. No attorney or solicitor was
allowed to appear before the commissioners as attorney or advocate
on behalf of either plaintiff or defendant, or to speak on any
cause or matter before the court in which he was not himself a
party or witness, under a penalty of five pounds for each offence.
It was further enacted “that no action or suit for any debt not
amounting to the sum of forty shillings, and recoverable by
virtue of this act in the said Court of Requests, should be brought
against any person or persons, residing or inhabiting within the
jurisdiction thereof, in any of the king’s courts at Westminster,
or any other court whatsoever, or elsewhere, out of the said
Court of Requests, and no suit which had been commenced in
the said Court of Requests in pursuance of this act, nor any
proceedings therein, should or might be removed to any superior
court, but the judgments, decrees, and proceedings of the said
court should be final and conclusive to all intents and purposes;
provided always, that nothing in this act should extend, or be
construed to extend, to prevent any person from suing for small<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
debts in any other court, where such suit might have been
instituted before the passing of this act.” The various fees to be
paid to the clerk of the court were—for entering every case, 6d.;
for issuing every summons, 6d.; for every subpœna, 6d.; for
calling every plaintiff or defendant before the court, 3d.; for
every hearing or trial, 6d.; for swearing every witness, plaintiff
or defendant, 3d.; for every order, judgment or decree, 6d.; for
a non-suit, 6d.; for every search in the books, 3d.; for paying
money into court, 6d., if by instalments, 6d. in the pound more;
for every execution, 6d.; for every warrant of commitment for
misconduct in court, 1s. The fees to the sergeant were—for
every summons, order, or subpœna, and attending court with the
return thereof, 6d.; for calling every plaintiff or defendant before
the court, 1d.; for executing every attachment, execution, or
warrant, against the body or goods, 1s.; for carrying every
plaintiff, defendant, or delinquent to prison, 6d. more for every
mile. Although this was purely a lay-court the commissioners
possessed and exercised the power of placing the witnesses on
oath previous to receiving their evidence. In 1847 the Court of
Requests was superseded by a new court, for the recovery of
debts not amounting to twenty pounds, which held its first sitting
on Monday, the 23rd of April in that year, under the presidency
of John Addison, esq., a barrister and the appointed judge, in the
room belonging to the Sunday school. This gentleman wore a
silk gown, as prescribed to the judges of these courts, and Mr.
Elletson, solicitor, the clerk, was also robed. At the first
assemblage the Rev. John Hull, M.A., the vicar, and Giles
Thornber, esq., J.P., were seated on each side of the judge. The
cases for trial or arbitration only numbered seventeen, and were
of little interest, so that the initiative sitting of the court was
but of short duration. The circuits apportioned to the judges
had an average population ranging from 202,713 to 312,220
persons, and the salary paid to each of these officials was £1,200
per annum. In the schedule of fees it was stated that for the
recovery of debts not exceeding 20s. the cost should be 3s.; under
40s., 5s.; under £5, 9s.; under £10, £1; under £20, £1 10s.;
and in jury cases 5s. would be charged for the jurymen, while the
other court charges would be a little increased. The powers of
this court, now designated the County Court, have been considerably<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
enlarged since its first establishment; the following
gentlemen are the officers at present connected with it:—</p>

<p>Little Poulton is the name given to a district and hamlet lying
on the east of Poulton township, and in it is situated the ancient
manorial residence called Little Poulton Hall, and now used as a
farm-house. The original mansion stood on the land immediately
at the rear of the existing edifice, which was erected about one
hundred and ten or twenty years ago. Until the occupation of
the present tenant, Mr. Singleton, the foundations of the old Hall
remained in the ground, but the indications afforded by them of
its dimensions and appearance were not of any great utility.
In 1570 Little Poulton Hall was occupied by George, the son of
Bartholomew Hesketh, of Aughton, a grandson of Thomas
Hesketh, of Rufford, but only in one of the junior lines. George
Hesketh married Dorothy, the daughter of William Westby, of
Mowbreck, and had issue one son, William, who inherited the
estate and resided at the Hall. William Hesketh was living in
1613, about forty years after the decease of his father, and had
two children, William and Wilfrid, by his wife Elizabeth, the
daughter of John Allen, of Rossall Hall. William, the eldest son,
seems to have removed to Maynes, or Mains, Hall, and settled
there during the lifetime of his father; it is probable that his
younger brother would remain at Little Poulton Hall, but of this
we have no positive proof, and consequently can advance it
merely as a conjecture. Little Poulton descended in the Heskeths,
of Mains, until about 1750, but the name of that family was
changed, after the marriage of William Hesketh, of Mains Hall,
(living in 1714), with Mary, the daughter of John Brockholes, of
Claughton, by Thomas Hesketh, the eldest son of that union, who
inherited the estates of his maternal uncle, and assumed the name
of Brockholes. Thomas Hesketh-Brockholes died without offspring,
and the property passed, successively, to his younger and
only surviving brothers, Joseph and James, both of whom adopted
the name and arms of Brockholes, and died childless; but by the
will of Joseph, Little Poulton and the other estates descended to
William Fitzherbert, the brother of his widow Constantia, the
daughter of Bazil Fitzherbert, of Swinnerton. William Fitzherbert<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
also assumed the title of Brockholes, and his descendant is the
present proprietor.</p>

<p>A family of the name of Barban preceded the Heskeths
at the manor house, and Gyles Curwen, a descendant of the
Curwens, of Workington, in Cumberland, espoused, about 1550,
the daughter and co-heiress of—Barban, of Little Poulton Hall,
having issue—Thomas, Elizabeth, Grace, and Winefrid. Thomas
Curwen died unmarried; Elizabeth became the wife of—Camden,
by whom she had William Camden, Clarenceux king-at-arms;
Winefrid married and settled in London; and Grace espoused
Gilbert Nicholson, of Poulton, by whom she had issue—Francis,
Grace, and Giles. Francis Nicholson had six children—Humphrey,
Grace, Bridget, Thomas, Isabell, and Dorothy. Grace Nicholson
married Thomas Braithwaite, of Beaumont, and was the mother
of nine children in 1613, the eldest, Geoffrey, being fifteen years
of age.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>On the south side of the Hall is a wood, covering about two
acres of land, and freshly planted within the last half century.
Until recent years, numerous decaying tree stocks were turned
up out of the soil, and their size plainly evidenced the massive
nature of the timber formerly growing there. There is a rookery
in the modern wood, and it is surmised that there was one also
amongst the branches of the ancient trees, and that a large
quantity of bullets discovered in a field on its outskirts record
the periodical onslaughts on the unfortunate rooks in days when
marksmen were not so unerring as long practice and improved
firearms have rendered them now. In the hamlet of Little
Poulton there are, in addition to the Hall, three antique houses
of considerable pretensions, which were erected and occupied by
persons of good social standing. One of them, on the opposite
side of the road, and a little removed from the old mansion, was
built by a gentleman named Fayle, and on an oaken beam
over a doorway, now bricked up, in an extensive barn, is the
inscription, EF: IF: 1675, the initials of the erector and his
wife, with the date when the edifice was completed. This
E. Fayle was probably a relative, perhaps grandfather, of
Edward Fayle, of the Holmes, Thornton, and afterwards of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
Bridge House, Bispham, who married, about 1728, Susannah,
the younger daughter of Edward Veale, of Whinney Heys, and
co-heiress, with her sister, of the Rev. John Veale, of the same
place, her only brother. Another respectable dwelling, but like
the few other buildings around, becoming dilapidated through
age, bears the initials of Henry Porter, and the date 1723, over
the entrance. From sundry documents which have come to
light, it seems that Henry Porter was a gentleman of influence
and position in the neighbourhood, but beyond that no information
can be gained concerning him or his descendants. The
tenement he held was purchased by the Brockholes, of Claughton,
in 1846. Close by the side of Porter’s residence is another of
the same model and size, apparently erected by A. Worswick in
1741, but of this person nothing is known. The remainder of
the hamlet is made up of a few old thatched cottages.</p>

<p>A free school was established by James Baines, draper, of
Poulton, in 1717, shortly before his death; and by his will, dated
that year, he bequeathed to Richard Wilson, Richard Whitehead,
sen., Richard Johnson, and Richard Thornton, of Hardhorn-with-Newton,
yeomen, to Richard Dickson, woollen draper, and
Samuel Bird, yeoman, of Poulton, to Robert Salthouse, of
Staining, yeoman, and to their heirs “all that Schoolhouse by
me lately erected in Hardhorn-in-Newton, and the parcel of
land whereon the same is erected, which is enjoyed therewith,
and which by me was lately purchased from Thomas Ords, to
remain, continue, and be a Free School for ever for the
persons and purposes hereinafter mentioned. Item: I give and
devise unto the seven said Trustees and their Heirs, all that
messuage and tenement, called Puddle House, with the lands
enjoyed therewith, about twenty-two acres, to the special end,
intent, and purpose, that the rents and profits over ten shillings a
year, (allowed for a dinner to the trustees, and their successors, on
their meeting about the affairs of this School on the second of
February, on which day they shall yearly meet for that purpose),
and after all costs for repairs at the said Schoolhouse and ground
it stands on be paid, the balance be given to such person as shall
yearly and every year be named, chosen, and appointed, by the
said seven Trustees, and their successors, or the major part of
them, to act as Schoolmaster, to teach and instruct in writing,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
reading, and other school learning, according to the best of his
capacity, all such children of the inhabitants of the townships
of Poulton and Hardhorn-in-Newton as shall be sent to the said
School, and behave themselves with care and good manners,
without any other payment or reward, except what the said
children or their parents shall voluntarily give.” The testament
then proceeds to direct that when any two of the seven trustees
died, the five surviving should at the cost of the estate appoint
two other of the “most able, discreet, and sufficient inhabitants
in Poulton and Hardhorn within three months,” and that such
a practice should be observed as occasion required “to the end
that the said charity may continue for ever according to the true
intent and meaning of this Will.” The Trustees were invested
with power to dismiss any schoolmaster and appoint a successor,
regarding whom there was the following clause:—“All Schoolmasters
on appointment shall give bond with one or more sureties
for good conduct, and be at duty from 7 a.m. to 11 a.m., and 1
p.m. to 5 p.m., except from the 1st November to 1st February, in
which quarter alone shall they attend on all school days from
8 a.m. to 11 a.m., and 1 p.m. to 4 p.m.; the afternoons of
Thursday and Saturday to be holiday.”</p>

<p>The schoolhouse is a whitewashed building, a single story high,
and has four windows in front, with one at each end. It stands
in the township of Hardhorn-with-Newton, about half a mile
from the town of Poulton, and has the annexed inscription fixed
on the wall facing the main road:—“This Charity School was
Founded and Endowed by Mr. James Baines, of Poolton, who
died the 9th January, 1717. Rebuilt 1818.” The lands
bequeathed by Mr. Baines have been exchanged for others of
greater value across the river Wyre. The attendance at present
is small.</p>

<p>Mr. Baines also left £800 to six trustees to be laid out in land,
half the annual income or interest from which he directed to be
devoted to the “maintenance, use, and best advantage of the
poorest sort of inhabitants of the township of Poulton, which
receive no relief by the Poor-rate,” and “for putting out poor
children of the said township apprentices yearly though their
parents receive relief by the Poor-rate.” The other moiety he
directed to be devoted to similar purposes in the townships of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
Marton, Hardhorn-with-Newton, Carleton, and Thornton.</p>

<p>Jenkinson’s Gift or Charity consists of the rents of a small
cottage with garden behind, and two detached crofts at Forton,
in Cockerham parish, and amounts to about £5 10s. per annum,
which is expended in the purchase of books for the scholars of
Baines’s school.</p>

<p>Nicholas Nickson, of Compley, in Poulton, by will dated the
12th of April, 1720, charged his estate with the payment, after
the decease of his widow, Alice Nickson, of £100 to the churchwardens
and overseers of Poulton, in trust, to invest the sum
and give half the interest to the vicar for the time being,
distributing the remainder amongst the poor house-keepers of
the township not in receipt of parish relief. Until the bequest
was paid, the heirs of Nickson, after the death of the widow, were
ordered to disburse five per cent. interest on the money each year.
In 1754 the trustees of this charity released the estate from all
charges in consideration of £100, the legacy, paid to them; and
on the 18th of July, 1783, Joseph Harrison and the four other
churchwardens of Poulton, together with William Brown and
Paul Harrison, the overseers, purchased from James Standen, for
£120, a close in Poulton, called Durham’s Croft, to hold the
same in trust and divide the rents into twelve parts, whereof five
were to be given to the vicar, five to indigent inhabitants not
receiving relief, and two in aid of the poor’s rates.</p>

<p class="dropcap">The site of the present town of Fleetwood was at no
very distant period, less than half a century ago, a
wild and desolate warren, forming part of the Rossall
estate, and belonging to the late Sir Peter Hesketh
Fleetwood, bart. At that date the northern side showed unmistakable
evidences of having at an earlier epoch been bounded by
a broad wall or rampart of star-hills, continuous with the range
until recent years visible near Rossall Point, or North Cape, as
that portion of the district was locally called, but which has now
been destroyed and levelled by the sea. Beyond the warrener’s
cottage and a small farm-house on the Poulton road, no habitations
existed anywhere in the vicinity; the whole tract of
sandhills and sward had been usurped by myriads of rabbits,
which were some little time, even after the erection of dwellings,
before they entirely deserted the spot where for centuries they
had found a home. During the stormy months of winter, and
in the breeding season, immense flocks of sea-fowl made their
way to these shores, and like the rabbits, were allowed to remain
in undisputed and undisturbed possession of the domain they had
appropriated.</p>

<p>Whether this district or locality was populated in the earlier
eras of history by any of the aboriginal Britons, invading Romans,
or piratical Danes, is a question difficult to solve, but the existence
of a paved Roman road, discovered some depth beneath the sand
when the trench for the sea-wall was being excavated opposite the
Mount Terrace, and traced across the warren in the direction of
Poulton, proves beyond a doubt that there was traffic of some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
description, either peaceful or war-like, over the ground at a very
remote age. The road is commonly designated the Danes’ Pad,
from a tradition that these freebooters made use of it during their
incursive warfare in the Fylde.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> Evidence in support of the
belief that this part of the coast was visited by the Danes or
Northmen, as the inhabitants of Scandinavia were called, is to be
found in “Knot End,” the name by which the projecting point
of land on the opposite side of Wyre has been known from time
immemorial. In early days there were both the “Great and Little
Knots,” or heaps of stones, but the works carried out for the
improvement of the harbour involved the destruction of the small,
and mutilation of the big “Knot.” Now arises the question,
why were these round collections of boulder stones called
“Knots?” In answer to which it may be stated that the word
“knot” is of pure Scandinavian origin, and in that ancient
Northern language always marked a round heap, and we
believe also a round heap of stones. This interpretation would
be characteristic of what these knots or mounds of stones were
before they were despoiled by the Wyre Harbour Company.
Such an application of the word to rounded hills of stone is
common at no great distance, and must have been applied by the
same people to all these rocky elevations, as instance Hard Knot,
Arnside Knot, and Farlton Knot, all of which indicate the name
by the rotundity of their stony summits, and seem to confirm
the opinion that the early inhabitants of Scandinavia visited the
coast, suggesting also that they had some settlement in its
immediate vicinity.</p>

<p>As regards the Romans, the only traces of their presence
which have been discovered in the neighbourhood of the town,
consist of the road above mentioned, and a number of ancient
coins which were found near Rossall, in 1840, by some labourers
engaged in brick-making. These coins, amounting in all to about
three hundred, were principally of silver, and bore the impresses
of Severus, Sabina, Antonius, Nerva, etc. It is quite possible,
however, that other relics belonging to that nation or the Danes,
may still exist, hidden by the sand, and more deeply imbedded
than it is necessary to sink when preparing for the foundations of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
the houses, whilst many also may have been submerged by the
encroaching waves as they have gradually inundated the north
and west sides of the district.</p>

<p>Doctor Leigh, in his Natural History of Lancashire, informs us
that at the mouth of the river Wyre there was in his time a
purging water which sprang up from out of the sand. “This, no
doubt,” says the Doctor, “is the sea-water which filters through
the sand, but by reason of the shortness of its filtration (the
spring lying so near the river), or the looseness of the sand, the
marine water is not perfectly dulcified, but retains a pleasing
brackishness, not unlike that which is observable in the milk of a
farrow cow, or one that has conceived.”</p>

<p>To the lord of the manor, Sir P. H. Fleetwood, is due the
credit of having first conceived the idea of converting the sterile
warren into a thriving seaport. Situated at the mouth of a river,
the security of whose stream had originated the proverb—“As
safe and as easy as Wyre water,” and by the side of a natural and
commodious harbour, sheltered from ever wind, the illustrious
baronet foresaw a prosperous future for the place, could he obtain
permission from parliament to construct a railway to its shores
from the important town of Preston, thereby creating a communication
with the manufacturing and commercial centres of Lancashire
and Yorkshire. In 1835, a number of gentlemen, denominated
the Preston and Wyre Railway, Harbour, and Dock Company,
having obtained the requisite powers, deputed Frederick Kemp,
esq., J.P., of Bispham Lodge, then acting as agent to Sir P. H.
Fleetwood, to purchase the land along the proposed route.
Operations were commenced with little delay, the work progressed
with fair rapidity, and on the 15th of July, 1840, the line
was declared open and ready for traffic.</p>

<p>In the meantime dwelling-houses, hotels, and a spacious wharf
had been springing into existence. In 1836 the earliest foundation
was laid at the south-west corner of Preston Street by Robert
Banton, of East Warren Farm. This farm was for a
short season a licensed house and brewery, and is now,
under the title of Warrenhurst, the private residence of J.
M. Jameson, esq., C.E. The new erection, which still bears
its original name of the Fleetwood Arms Hotel, made no further
progress for about a year, when it was completed by Thomas<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
Parkinson, the head carpenter at Rossall Hall. The first building
finished and inhabited in Fleetwood was a beer-house at the
south-west corner of Church Street, which was erected in
1836-7, and is now a shop, owned and occupied by Richard
Warbrick, outfitter. That small inn or licensed dwelling was in
the occupation of a person named Parker, a stonemason, who a
little later built the Victoria Hotel, in Dock-street, where he
removed and resided for several months, until a sale of the
property had been effected.</p>

<p>The streets were marked out by the plough according to the
design of Decimus Burton, esq., architect, of London, and so
arranged that all the principal thoroughfares, with the exception
of the main road of entrance to the town, converged towards the
largest star-hill, now known as the Mount, on the highest point
of which was placed a small decagon Chinese edifice, surrounded
by a raised platform or terrace, whence an extensive view of
the broad bay of Morecambe, the lofty ranges of Lancashire,
Cumberland, and Westmoreland, and a wide circuit of the
neighbouring country could be obtained. The hollow on the
south side of the mound was fashioned into the form of a basin,
and a semicircular gravelled walk carried along the ridge of each
side, leading with a gentle ascent from the entrance gates on the
warren at the end of London Street to the summit, whilst the
slopes were tastefully arranged and planted with shrubs, to impart
a pleasing and ornamental appearance to the otherwise bare
sward. These shrubs, as might have been foreseen, speedily
withered and perished, owing to the bleakness of the site, and
a lack of that indispensable moisture which the dry sandy soil
could neither retain nor supply. In earlier days the Mount was
commonly known as Tup, or Top, Hill, and formed a favourite
resort for pic-nic parties from Blackpool, or some of the
surrounding villages, which visited the place during the summer
months, to admire the innumerable sea-fowl and their nests, the
latter being scattered over the shore in endless profusion.</p>

<p>Building proceeded with rapid strides; house after house
sprang up in the lines of streets, which had only lately received
their first coating of shingle, and in 1841, one year after the
opening of the railway, the town had assumed considerable proportions.
Near the entrance from Poulton road were three or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
four double rows of cottages for the accommodation of the
workpeople, and a Roman Catholic chapel. Preston Street
contained but few houses in addition to the Fleetwood Arms
Hotel; thence, travelling eastward were Dock Street, with the
Crown Hotel, as far as and including the Victoria Hotel; the east
side of Warren Street, the west side of St. Peter’s Place, the
church and Sunday school, both sides of Church Street, Custom
House Lane, the Lower Queen’s Terrace, the North Euston Hotel,
and the bath houses. The Upper Queen’s Terrace was in process
of erection, but was not completed until 1844, after having been
allowed, for some reason, to remain in a partially finished state for
two years.</p>

<p>The church, standing on a raised plot of ground in the centre
of the town and surrounded by an iron palisading, is dedicated to
St. Peter, and was first opened for divine service in 1841. It is
a stone edifice with a square tower and octagonal spire at the
west end, and was erected by voluntary contributions, the site
being provided by Sir P. H. Fleetwood, who retained the right of
presentation to the living. The interior of the building is neat,
and contains sittings for about four hundred persons in the body,
with additional accommodation for two hundred more in the
gallery, at the end of which are the choir-pew and organ-loft, the
latter being occupied by an instrument constructed by Gray, of
London. Previous to the alterations, which were made seventeen
years since, and consisted of the erection of a gallery and the
convertion of some of the private pews into free seats, the family
pew of the Fleetwoods stood in front of the organ-loft, and was
the only one raised out of the body of the church. The chancel
window is of stained glass, large and handsome, representing a
central figure of St. Peter bearing the Keys of Heaven, below and
on each side of which several scriptural subjects are illustrated.
This window, purchased by subscription amongst the parishioners,
was inserted in 1860; and in the previous year a handsome font
of Caen stone was presented by Mrs. G. Y. Osborne. Two upright
tablets, the gift of the late vicar, the Rev. G. Y. Osborne, illuminated
with the Ten Commandments, are placed, one on each
side of the Communion table. Four other tablets are fixed against
the walls of the church, the first of which was erected by a few
friends as a tribute of respect to the memory of Dobson Ward,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
died 1859, aged 43 years, a humble but zealous worker in the
Sunday school; another was placed by the Rev. G. Y. Osborne,
in loving memory of his deceased daughter; the third, a handsome
tablet, was erected at the entrance to the vestry, by parishioners
and friends, to the memory of the Rev. G. Y. Osborne, “for 19
years vicar of this parish, who died 11 November, 1871, aged 53
years,”<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> and the last is to the memory of Charles Stewart, esq.,
died 1873, aged 64 years, late of High Leigh, Cheshire, and
Fleetwood. The living, endowed with the great tithes of
Thornton and augmented by the pew rents, was originally a
perpetual curacy, but during the ministry of the late Rev. G. Y.
Osborne, a distinct district or parish for all ecclesiastical purposes
was assigned to the church, and the title of vicar accorded to the
incumbent.</p>

<p>The burial ground connected with the church is part of the
general cemetery, situated near the shore in the direction of the
Landmark at Rossall Point, and about one mile distant from the
town.</p>

only, was for several years, until the erection of the Testimonial
Schools, the ordinary Sunday school under the superintendence
of the incumbent of St. Peter’s.</p>

<p>The Market Place, opened on the 7th of November, 1840, is a

<p>Since the date of the above quotations, Preston has gradually
monopolised the chief portion of the grain trade, and consequently
transactions in oats and other cereals are not of frequent occurrence
at the local markets of the Fylde.</p>

<p>The Roman Catholic chapel, dedicated to the Blessed Virgin,
was erected at the north end of Walmsley Street, continuous
with the line of houses forming the east side of that street, and
opened for divine worship on the 15th of November, 1841. A
few years since a more commodious edifice, which will be
described hereafter, was erected on another and better site, whilst
the old one was dismantled, and subsequently converted into
cottages.</p>

<p>The Crown Hotel, a handsome and substantial stone structure
facing the Railway Station, was the third hotel erected in Fleetwood,
the Fleetwood Arms being the first, and the Victoria the
second in point of completion. The original dimensions of the
Crown have been considerably increased by the addition in recent
years of ample stable accommodation, a large billiard room, and
several sleeping apartments.</p>

<p>The North Euston Hotel, which was opened almost<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
simultaneously with the Crown Hotel, is a superb stone
building in the form of a crescent, with a frontage of nearly
300 feet. This edifice was sold to Government in 1859, and subsequently
opened as a School of Musketry. The noble portico in
front of the main entrance and the spacious hall within are supported
by massive stone pillars, whilst a handsome terrace, raised
a little above the level of the street, encircles the whole length
of the ground floor, and is protected by an ornamental
iron railing. On its transfer to Government, quarters were
provided for sixty officers and a staff of military instructors.
There were three chief courses of instruction held during each
year, but in addition to these were two of shorter duration, one
being in the month of January for the adjutants of volunteers,
and another a little later for the volunteers themselves.
The curriculum was similar to that at Hythe. In 1867 the
School of Musketry was discontinued, and after a short interval,
in which fresh buildings were added, the whole structure
was turned into barracks, and as such continues to be occupied.
In the early days of the hotel a T-shaped jetty extended out from
the steps on the shore opposite the principal entrance to the
distance of low-water mark, and was used by the visitors as a
short promenade and landing stage, but after standing a few
years the erection was removed, being found to interfere with the
course of the steamers and other vessels round that section of the
channel.</p>

<p>The bath-houses, each of which contained a spacious sea-water
swimming bath, were connected with the North Euston Hotel,
and therefore became the property of Government on the transfer
of the main building itself. Since that date their internal
arrangements have undergone material alterations and modifications
to suit the requirements of the military, but their handsome
stone exteriors and massive porticoes are still intact.</p>

<p>The custom-house on the Lower Queen’s Terrace is now a
private residence in the occupation of Alexander Carson, esq.,
who is also the owner, and the offices have for many years been
situated in a house of more modest pretensions in the same row.</p>

<p>The two lighthouses, one of which is placed in Pharos Street
and the other further north, on the margin of the beach, were
also in existence in 1841, having been erected a short time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
previously. The former is a tall circular column of painted stone,
having an altitude of about 90 feet above high-water mark. The
base of the column is square, each of the sides being 12 feet high
and 20 broad. The focus of the lantern is 104 feet above half-tide
level, and outside the reflector is a narrow, circular, stone gallery,
guarded by an iron fencing. The cost of the column was £1,480.
The other lighthouse is much smaller, and stands on a slightly
elevated plot of ground. Each side of its base forms a recess,
furnished with seats, and supported above by round stone pillars.
The centre of the lantern is 44 feet above half-tide level. The
whole fabric, which is built throughout of finely cut stone, was
erected at a cost of £1,375.</p>

<p>We have now reviewed the general appearance of the town in
1841, including brief accounts of all the more important buildings,
but accidentally omitting to state that gas works were amongst
the early erections, and before proceeding with the history of its
further progress and increase, it will be convenient to revert for a
moment to the railway and matters connected with it, leaving,
however, the harbour, wharf, and shipping for separate examination
towards the later pages of the chapter. The railway,
consisting of a single line throughout the whole extent, was
carried over a portion of the estuary of the Wyre, along an
embankment and viaduct of huge wooden piles, running from
Burn Naze to the west extremity of the wharf at Fleetwood, near
to which the station is situated. In 1846 the traffic, both in
passengers and goods, had increased so rapidly that the directors
determined to have a double line without delay. Instructions for
that purpose were accordingly issued to the engineer of the
company, and at the same time he was directed that, in order to
afford space and facilities for the construction of the proposed
docks to the westward of the existing railway piling, the double
line should diverge at Burn Naze, run round the Cops, and
terminate as before. The programme here stated was not
fully carried out, and the double line extended only as far as Burn
Naze, from which point a single line ran along a semicircular
embankment, lying west of the old one, to the terminus at
Fleetwood.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> This embankment was the means of rescuing from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
the incursions of the tide about 400 acres of marsh land, which
has since by drainage and cultivation been converted into
excellent pastures and productive fields. The entire line was leased,
under acts of 1846, to the Lancashire and Yorkshire and London
and North Western Railway companies, the former taking two
thirds and the latter one third of the profits or losses. The terms
agreed upon were a rent of £7 1s. 6d. per cent., and £1 15s. 4½d.
per share on a total capital of £668,000, until the close of 1854,
when the payments were raised to £7 17s. 6d. per cent., and
£1 19s. 3½d. per share in perpetuity. In the month of July,
1846, the electric telegraph in connection with the Preston and
Wyre Railway was introduced into the town, and as its first public
act was the interception, at Kirkham, of a defaulting steamship
passenger, who had neglected to pay her fare, it may be
concluded that the inhabitants welcomed the ingenious invention
as a valuable ally in the protection of their commercial interests,
as well as a rapid and convenient mode of friendly intercommunion
in cases of urgency.</p>

<p>The Improvement Act, for “paving, lighting, cleansing, and
otherwise improving the town of Fleetwood and the neighbourhood
thereof, and for establishing a market therein,” came into
operation on the 18th of June, 1842. Meetings were appointed
to be held on the first Monday in every month, at which any male
person was empowered to sit as a commissioner on producing
evidence that he was either a resident within the limits prescribed
by the act, and rated to the poor-rates of the township of Thornton
for a local tenement of the annual value of £15, or possessed
as owner or lessee or in the enjoyment of the rents and profits of
a messuage, lands, or hereditaments, similarly situated and rated,
for a term of not less than fifty years. In 1869 authority was
obtained to repeal certain sections of the old act and adopt others
from the Public Health Act of 1848, and the Local Government
Act of 1858, the most important being that in future the Board
of Commissioners should consist of twelve members only, having
personally the same qualifications as before, but being elected by
the ratepayers. The new regulations also ordained that one third
of the commissioners should retire each year, and the vacancies
be filled up by a general election. This act is still in force.</p>

<p>It was not possible that the claims of a place so happily situated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
as Fleetwood for a summer residence could long remain unrecognised
by the inhabitants of the inland towns. No sooner was free
access given to its shores by the opening of the railway in 1840,
than the hotels and lodging-houses were inundated with visitors,
whose annual return testified to their high appreciation of its
mild climate, firm sands, excellent boating accommodation, and
lastly, the diversified and beautiful scenery of the broad bay of
Morecambe. A number of bathing vans were stationed on the
shore opposite the Mount, but were little patronised during the
first two or three seasons owing to the proprietors demanding 1s.
from each person using them, a sum exactly double that required
at other watering-places. The injurious effects of this exorbitant
charge were speedily experienced, not only by the van owners,
whose receipts were reduced to a minimum, but generally
throughout the town, as visitors who greatly preferred Fleetwood
were driven to other places on that account, and each year many
who came with the intention of remaining during the summer
left because their families were debarred from bathing, except at
an excessive cost. The error of so grasping a policy being at last
demonstrated to the proprietors by the small and diminishing
patronage extended to their vans, it was resolved, in 1844, to
reduce the charge to 6d. That year several newly-erected houses
in Kemp Street were furnished and tenanted, whilst the hitherto
unoccupied stone residences comprised in the Upper Queen’s
Terrace were fitted up with elegance and convenience for the
wealthier class of sojourners, to whom they were let for periods
varying from a few weeks to three or four months. The terrace
of houses situated between the North Euston Hotel and the
Mount, and bearing the latter name, was also completed that
year. The prices at the North Euston Hotel were arranged as
under:—</p>

<p>During the Whit-week of 1844 the place was crowded with
excursionists, many of whom, amounting to 1,000 daily, were
carried at half fare by the Preston and Wyre Railway, and came
from the neighbouring towns and villages, whilst others arrived<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
by sea in excursion boats from Dublin, the Isle of Man, Ulverstone,
Blackpool, and Southport. Festivities were entered into
on the warren and slopes of the Mount, lasting three days and
consisting of horse, pony, donkey, foot, sack, and wheelbarrow
races, a cricket match, foot steeplechases, wrestling, and gingling
matches.</p>

<p>In 1844 Fleetwood was reduced from a distinct port to a creek
under Preston, and during the month of July the mayor of the
latter town paid a state visit to the watering-place, arriving by
sea in the small steamer “Lily.” A series of misfortunes rather
tended to upset the dignity and imposing aspect of the official
cortege. A somewhat rough sea retarded their passage and
rapidly converted the ship into a temporary hospital for that,
perhaps, most distressing of all sicknesses; nearing, at last, the
lighthouse at the foot of Wyre, a large portion of the larboard gunwale
was carried away by the bowsprit of the steamer “Express,”
which had been sent out to meet and tow them into harbour, if
necessary; and finally the unfortunate “Lily” stranded on a bank
opposite the beach at Fleetwood, and the mayoral party, now
pallid and dejected, in their gorgeous robes and liveries, were
brought to land in small open boats, and having formed the
following order, marched to the North Euston Hotel, where a
banquet was prepared:—</p>

<ul class="smaller">
<li>Three Policemen.</li>
<li>Two Sergeants-at-Mace.</li>
<li>Mace Bearer.</li>
<li>The Mayor in his Robes of Office.</li>
<li>The Corporation Steward.</li>
<li>Recorder of the Borough.</li>
<li>The Aldermen of the Borough.</li>
<li>The Members of the Common Council.</li>
<li>Military Officers and Private Gentlemen.</li>
<li>Town Crier and Beadle.</li>
</ul>

<p>This year the Preston and Wyre Railway Company, in conjunction
with the line from Manchester and Bolton, commenced to
run Sunday excursion trains to Fleetwood at reduced fares during
the genial months of summer, and in August upwards of ten
thousand pleasure-seekers were estimated to have been brought
into the town by their means alone. These lines were amongst
the first to try the experiment of cheap trains, and the immense
success which attended their efforts on the above occasions soon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
induced them to extend the privileges to other days besides the
Sabbath. The promoters of private excursions, also, were offered
facilities to direct their course to this watering-place. During the
summer of 1844 no less than 60,000 people in all, that is including
both day excursionists and those who remained for longer
periods, arrived, being considerably more than in any previous
season. In July, 1846, the whole of the workpeople of Richard
Cobden, esq., M.P., the great free-trade statesman, visited the
town to celebrate the triumph of free-trade principles in parliament,
the entire expense of the trip being defrayed by that
gentleman. Each of the operatives and others, numbering
about 1,300, had a free-trade medal suspended by a ribbon
from the neck; and, having formed in procession, the large
assembly paraded through the streets of Fleetwood, carrying
banners adorned with such appropriate mottoes and inscriptions
as “Free Trade with all the World,” “Peel, Bright, and
Cobden,” etc. In the same year an immense Sunday school trip,
bringing no less than 4,200 children and adults, arrived; and
after amusing themselves by rambling about the shore for a time,
the youthful multitude formed a huge pic-nic party on the
warren. This was without doubt the largest single excursion
which ever visited these shores, and on its return, the enormous
train of two engines and fifty-six carriages, many of which were
cattle trucks provided with forms and covered in with canvas, was
divided, each engine taking half, for fear of accidents and delays.
In later times it was no uncommon circumstance to see the spacious
wharf opposite the Upper and Lower Queen’s Terraces, crowded
with cheap trains during Easter and Whit-weeks. Hourly trips
in the small steam tug-boats or pleasure yachts, pony and donkey
rides, bathing, and mussel gathering on the bank opposite the
Mount Terrace were the chief amusements of the day visitors,
and innumerable were the exclamations of wonder and delight
uttered by thousands, who for the first time beheld</p>

<p class="noindent">at Fleetwood, for our readers may be reminded that at the date of
which we are writing, railway fares, except on special occasions,
were beyond the compass of the labouring populations of our
manufacturing and agricultural districts, and consequently a visit
to the, in many cases unknown, sea, was an event eagerly anticipated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
and long remembered.</p>

<p>In January, 1845, a general meeting of those who were
interested in Fleetwood, or wished to testify their respect and
admiration for the noble efforts of the founder of the town, was
held at the North Euston Hotel, to determine upon the most
suitable public testimonial to be erected in honour of Sir Peter
Hesketh Fleetwood. Doctor Ramsay proposed that day schools
for 200 children of the labouring classes, with a house for a
master and mistress, having the name of the “Fleetwood Testimonial
Schools,” open to all denominations of Christians and
connected with the National Society, should be erected. This
resolution was carried without a dissentient; subscription lists
were opened; and on Wednesday, the 26th of August, 1846, the
foundation stone of the building was laid by Charles Swainson,
esq., of Preston. Large numbers arrived early in the morning to
be present at the ceremony. The town, shipping, and river craft,
decked out in bunting, presented quite a gala appearance as the
officials and guests proceeded to the site in West Street. The
procession marched as stated below:—</p>

<ul class="smaller">
<li>The Beadle.</li>
<li>Band.</li>
<li>The Wesleyan Sunday School Children.</li>
<li>The Independent Sunday School Children.</li>

<li>The Gentry and Visitors.</li>
<li>The Tradesmen.</li>
<li>Independent Order of Oddfellows.</li>
<li>The Rechabites.</li>

<p>In the cavity beneath the foundation stone were enclosed a
bottle containing coins of the present reign, a copy of the
<i>Fleetwood Chronicle</i> of that date, printed on parchment, and
another sheet of parchment inscribed thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

to the benevolent founder of this town, Sir P. H. Fleetwood, Bart., M.P.,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
was laid by Charles Swainson, Esq., of Preston, this 26th day of August, 1846.</p>

</div>

<p>This scholastic institution is in the Gothic style of architecture,
and the principal front, facing into West Street, extends over a
distance of seventy-one feet. The interior of the building
contains separate school accommodation for boys and girls; and
at the east end there is a comfortable residence for the mistress.
The school is surrounded by an extensive play-ground, and
enclosed by a brick wall, surmounted anteriorly by ornamental
iron railings. Since the building was completed the provision
for the reception of boys has been greatly increased by the
erection of a new wing, by private munificence, abutting at right
angles with the east end of the original structure.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1845 a handsome promenade and carriage
drive was completed along the border of the shore from the North
Euston Hotel to the west extremity of the Mount Terrace. The
pathway, which ran on the inner side of the drive, was flagged
throughout its entire length, whilst the outer margin of the road
was connected with a substantial sea-wall of square-cut stone by a
broad and well-kept grass plat. Subsequently this elegant walk
was extended round the south side of the Mount, along Abbots’
Walk, and so on by the side of the shore to the Cemetery Road.
Very little of the portion first constructed is now to be seen, and
that remnant is in such a dilapidated condition as almost to be
impassable. Huge stones which formerly protected the green
sward and road from the waves are now lying scattered and
buried about the beach; whilst the westerly end of the promenade
has not only suffered utter annihilation itself, but serious inroads
have been made by the water into the ornamental gardens
fronting the houses of the Mount Terrace.</p>

<p>Strenuous efforts were put forth during the autumn of 1845 to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
prevent the visitors forsaking the town immediately the long
evenings had commenced; pyrotechnic displays took place each
week on the plot of land lying to the north of the Upper Queen’s
Terrace, and designated the Archery Ground. Sea excursions to
Blackpool, Southport, and Piel Harbour were liberally provided
for by the steamers of the port; a military band was hired for
several weeks, and played daily either on one of the pleasure
craft or near the new promenade; foot races, wrestling, and
cricket matches were arranged and contested at short intervals.
But all in vain, for towards the end of August the reflux of
visitors had thoroughly set in, and by the middle of September
the shores were almost deserted. During that brief period of
excitement it was proposed amongst the inhabitants to erect a
large public building to be ready for the ensuing season, which
should combine all the advantages of a reading and news
room, public library, bazaar, ball room, and theatre; but either
the ardour of the people cooled during the winter months or they
failed to discern a fair prospect of dividends from the investment,
for the summer of 1846 discovered that the idea had vanished
with the closing year, and</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Like the baseless fabric of a vision,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Left not a wreck behind.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Perhaps, however, it is going too far to assert that no trace or
vestige of the comprehensive project remained after the first
ebullition of enthusiasm had passed from the popular mind, for we
find that, although no noble hall graced the town, a Mechanics’
Institution was modestly established on the 18th of May, 1846,
by the opening of a reading room in one portion of the Estate
Office. This office formerly occupied the site of the present
Whitworth Institute, and was a small, lightly constructed, Gothic
edifice. Subsequently a larger and more convenient place for
the purposes of the Institution was engaged in Dock Street; a
library was provided and arrangements made for lectures and
classes to be held on the premises. In the report of the establishment,
issued twelve months after its foundation, it was stated that
the members at that date amounted to 184, being 138 full
members, 20 females, and 26 youths and apprentices; and that
since its organisation 213 persons had availed themselves of the
privileges offered by the society. A considerable number of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
cottage houses were erected in different parts of the town, and not
only were these tenanted directly they were completed, but the
demand for further building was still on the increase. A public
abattoir, or slaughter-house, was constructed in 1846 on the
outskirts of the town, and a notice issued, prohibiting the slaying of
any cattle, sheep, or swine anywhere except within its walls, under
a penalty of £5 for every offence. A Wesleyan chapel was also
in course of erection in North Church Street, then open warren,
and finished the following year, divine service being first conducted
in it on Monday, the 24th of May, by the Rev. George
Osborne, of Liverpool. As the town gradually developed in size
and population, the attendants at this place of worship outgrew
the space provided for them, and lately, in 1875, it became
necessary to enlarge the edifice. The west gable-end was taken
out and the main building extended in that direction. Galleries
were placed along the two sides and across the east wall; the old-fashioned
pulpit was superseded by a platform situated at the
centre of the west end, and extending to within six feet of the
galleries at either side. The new sittings resemble the old ones
in being closed pews, and not open benches. The chapel is now
capable of containing double the congregation it could have held
previous to the recent alterations.</p>

<p>In the month of February, 1847, an extraordinary high tide,
rendered more formidable by strong westerly winds, did great
damage on the coast from here to Rossall; the Landmark was so
far undermined that its fall was hourly expected; an embankment
raised on the shore from that point to Rossall suffered severely,
large portions being completely washed away; and the outbuildings
of a farm called “Fenny” were overthrown and destroyed, serious
injury being done also to the land in the neighbourhood. The
more immediate vicinities of the town escaped with comparatively
little loss, the most important being that resulting from the
inundation of several fields and gardens near the Cops, and the
levelling of a few wooden sheds for labourers’ tools and other
outbuildings.</p>

<p>A failure in the potatoe and grain harvests of 1846 spread
fearful distress and famine throughout the United Kingdom;
bread riots and disturbances amongst the starving poor of Ireland
were of frequent occurrence, and it was to assist in alleviating the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
sufferings of those unfortunate people that a subscription was started
in Fleetwood during the latter months of that year. Donations
purely from the inhabitants of the town were collected, and in
January, 1847, the sum of £105 was forwarded to the sister
country. In consequence of the severe national affliction, Her
Majesty ordained that Wednesday, the 24th of the following
March, should be observed as a general fast-day. On that date
all the shops in the watering place, with one or two exceptions,
were closed; the public-houses and streets were quiet; and
stillness and solemnity everywhere apparent. The church was
crowded to overflowing; every seat was packed, and forms were
brought in from the Sunday school and placed in the aisles
to create extra accommodation, so excessive was the congregation
which assembled to join in the special service for divine
intervention.</p>

<p>On Monday, the 20th of September, 1847, Her Majesty, Queen
Victoria, accompanied by their Royal Highnesses, the Prince
Consort, the Prince of Wales, and the Princess Royal, landed at
Fleetwood <i>en route</i> from Scotland to London. The spot fixed for
the debarkation of the royal party was near the north end of the
covered pier, upwards of 100 feet of which were boarded off and
converted into a saloon, a covered gallery being erected leading
from it to the railway, where the special train was stationed.
The floors of the saloon and gallery were covered with crimson
drugget and at the entrance to the former a beautiful triumphal
arch was formed of various coloured draperies, and adorned
with the national flag and other emblems of loyalty. The
walls of the saloon were hung with white and coloured
draperies, festooned with evergreens, and British ensigns were
suspended from the roof. This elegant apartment contained a
gallery for ladies at the north end, and near to the entrance was
a small octagonal throne, having an ascent of three steps, upon
which a handsome gilded chair of state and a footstool were placed.
Behind the two latter, draperies of crimson cloth were suspended,
surmounted by the Arms of Her Majesty. On Sunday, the 19th
of September, the High-sheriff of the county of Lancaster,
William Gale, esq., of Lightburne House, near Ulverston, who
had arrived in order to receive Her Majesty on the following day,
attended divine worship at St. Peter’s Church, being driven there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
in his state carriage, drawn by four splendid greys and preceded
by his trumpeters and twenty-four javelin men with halberds.
Monday was ushered in with boisterous winds, a cloudy sky, and
other indications of unpropitious weather, which fortunately for
the thousands who crowded into the place from Yorkshire,
Manchester, and intermediate localities, considerably improved
as the day advanced. The ships in the harbour were draped with
flags, and similar decorations floated from the windows of almost
every house. A little after three o’clock in the afternoon the
report of a signal gun announced that the royal squadron,
consisting of the Victoria and Albert, the Black Eagle, the Fairy,
the Garland, and the Undine, was in sight, and as the noble
vessels steamed up the channel the North Euston Hotel and the
Pier burst out into brilliant illuminations. As soon as the royal
yacht, Victoria and Albert, had been safely moored to the quay
opposite the triumphal arch, and the gangways adjusted, the High-sheriff,
W. Gale, esq.; Lieut.-General Sir Thomas Arbuthnot,
K.C.B.; Sir P. H. Fleetwood, bart.; Major-General Sir William
Warre; John Wilson Patten, esq., M.P.; the Rev. St. Vincent
Beechey, incumbent of Fleetwood; Henry Houldsworth, esq.,
chairman of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company;
George Wilson, esq., deputy-chairman; and Thomas H. Higgin,
esq., managing director of the Preston and Wyre district;
presented their cards, and explained to Captain Beechey the
several arrangements which had been made for Her Majesty’s
conveyance to London. Afterwards Sir P. H. Fleetwood, the Rev.
St. Vincent Beechey, Frederick Kemp, and James Crombleholme,
esqrs., of Fleetwood; and Daniel Elletson, esq., of Parrox Hall,
were admitted to an interview with Lord Palmerston, who, on
behalf of Her Majesty, received the subjoined address from the
inhabitants of Fleetwood, printed in gold on white satin, and
promised that it should be laid before the Queen:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">“<span class="smcap">The Loyal and Dutiful<br />
ADDRESS<br />
of the<br />
Inhabitants of Fleetwood,<br />
TO HER MOST GRACIOUS MAJESTY THE QUEEN.</span></p>

<p class="noindent">“<i>May it Please your Majesty</i>,</p>

<p>“We, the Inhabitants of the Town of Fleetwood, in the county of Lancaster,
desire to approach your Majesty on this auspicious occasion, with the most sincere<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
expression of our devoted loyalty and attachment to your Majesty, of our deep
respect and esteem for your Majesty’s august Consort, for his Royal Highness
the Prince of Wales, and the other members of the Royal Family.</p>

<p>“We beg to assure your Majesty that it is with feelings of the liveliest gratitude
that we hail this Royal visit to our humble shores, now for the first time pressed
by the foot of Sovereignty.</p>

<p>“We rejoice to think that it has fallen to our happy lot to be the first to
welcome the Queen of England to her own Royal Patrimony in the Duchy of
Lancaster.</p>

<p>“We hasten to lay at your Majesty’s feet the dutiful allegiance of the inhabitants
of the youngest Town and Port in all your Majesty’s dominions, which dates its
existence from the very year in which your Majesty first ascended the Throne of
these realms; and which, from the barren and uninhabited sands of the Fylde of
Lancashire, has already obtained some importance for its town of 3,000 inhabitants,
its Watering-place, Harbour, and Railway, together with its College for the sons
of clergymen and other gentlemen.</p>

<p>“We sincerely trust, that the natural facilities and local arrangements of this
Port may be found such as shall conduce to the safety, comfort, and convenience of
your Majesty in your royal progress. And we beseech your Majesty to receive
our united and solemn assurance, that whatever progress our Harbour and Town
may make in wealth and importance, it shall ever be our firmest determination
and most earnest prayer, that we may never cease to boast of a loyal population,
entertaining the same feeling of devoted duty and attachment to your Majesty and
the Royal Family, which we experience at this moment, and which the grateful
remembrance of this Royal visit must ever tend to keep alive in our bosoms.</p>

<p>“Signed on behalf of the Inhabitants,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">St. Vincent Beechey</span>, M.A., Incumbent of Fleetwood.”</p>

</div>

<p>To the foregoing address the annexed reply was received from
London in the course of a few days:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“Whitehall, 25th September, 1847.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,—I am directed by the Secretary, Sir George Grey, to inform you, that
the Loyal and Dutiful Address of the Inhabitants of Fleetwood, on the occasion
of Her Majesty’s late visit, has been laid before the Queen, and that the same was
very graciously received by Her Majesty.</p>

<p>“I have the honour to be, Sir, your obedient servant,</p>

<p class="center">(Signed)</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Dennis le Merchant</span>.</p>

<p>“Rev. St. Vincent Beechey, Incumbent of Fleetwood.”</p>

</div>

<p>Early next morning the handsome saloon was occupied by the
High-sheriff, the Under-sheriff, and a select number of gentlemen,
and shortly after ten o’clock Her Majesty and the royal party
proceeded from the yacht to the special train amid joyful
acclamations which resounded from all parts of the shore. The
moment Her Majesty set foot, for the first time, on her Duchy of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
Lancaster, the royal standard was lowered from the mast-head
of the yacht, and instantly raised on the flag-staff at the custom-house
of Fleetwood, where it received a salute of twenty-one guns.
After another salute of a similar number of guns, as Her Majesty
reached the end of the gallery, the royal party entered their
saloon carriage, Mr., now Sir John, Hawskshaw, engineer to the
Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company, took his station on
the engine, and the train moved slowly off, followed by the ringing
cheers of at least ten thousand spectators.</p>

<p>It should be mentioned that a loyal address, written in Latin,
from the students of the Northern Church of England School, at
Rossall, arrived too late for presentation, and was afterwards
forwarded to London.</p>

<p>In the month of July, 1847, Mr. Thomas Drummond, contractor,
commenced the erection of the present Independent Chapel in
West Street, and notwithstanding a serious delay through the
destruction of the north gable and roof-framing by a heavy gale
in September, the building was completed the same year. The
edifice, which will contain about 600 persons, is a neat brick
structure with side buttresses, and adorned with a castellated
tower. Beneath the chapel are spacious school-rooms for boys
and girls. The site was granted by Sir P. H. Fleetwood, and
conveyed in trust for the use of the church and congregation.</p>

<p>For two or three years little of special interest occurred in the
progress or condition of the town. Each summer brought its
assembly of regular visitors, upon whom many of the inhabitants
depended for support, whilst Whit-week annually inundated the
warren, streets, and shores with crowds of day-excursionists, for
whose benefit sports, resembling those to which allusion has
already been made, were instituted. Regattas also were added to
the other attractions of the watering-place, but after existing for
some little time they gradually died out, either because they
failed to excite their former interest amongst the visitors, or the
public spirit of the inhabitants was tardy in providing the funds
necessary for their continuance. Houses in Albert Street, and in
other parts of the town, were slowly increasing in number, but no
large demand for dwellings bespoke a rapid rise in the prosperity
or popularity of the place, like that to which we referred a little
earlier. Trade, although comparatively steady, evinced no signs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
of enlargement at present, and as a consequence fresh families
hesitated to venture their fortunes in the new land, until some
more regular and reliable means of gaining a livelihood were
offered them than the precarious patronage of uncertain visitors,
many of whom, now that free access had been given to Blackpool
and Lytham through the opening of branch lines, were already
being seduced from their old allegiance to Fleetwood, and attracted
to the gayer promenades of those rival resorts.</p>

<p>In the month of December, 1852, and just at the Christmas
season, a fearful hurricane swept over Fleetwood; slates, chimney
tops, and boardings were torn from their fastenings, and hurled
about the streets; indeed so terrific was the violence of this gale
that at its height it was difficult for the pedestrian to avoid being
forced along by its fury in whatsoever direction the huge gusts
willed. During the storm a singular accident occurred in the
harbour. The barque “Hope,” which had arrived shortly before
from America with timber, was lying in the river attached to one
of the buoys, and by some carelessness the men employed in
unloading her had neglected, on leaving their work, to close up the
large square hole near the stem of the ship, through which the
baulks of wood were discharged. The hurricane came on fiercely
and suddenly from the west, and, to the dismay of the solitary
watchman who had been left in charge of the vessel, heeled over
her lightened hull so that the swollen and boisterous tide poured
wave after wave through the unprotected aperture at her bows; a
few minutes only were needed to complete the catastrophe, for as
the vessel settled in the deep, no longer waves but continuous
volumes of water rushed into her, and with a heavy lurch she
rolled over on her side, the masts and more than half her hull
being submerged. Fortunately, however, the remnant of the
cargo was sufficiently buoyant to prevent her from vanishing
bodily beneath the surface. The luckless guardian, whose feelings
must have been far from enviable, was quickly rescued from the
perilous position he occupied on the floating portion of the ship;
but it was not until some weeks afterwards that they were able, in
the words of the poet Cowper,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“To weigh the vessel up.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The “Hope,” 415 tons register, was built up the river at the old
port of Wardleys, being the only vessel of such dimensions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
constructed in the shipyard there. Ten years later, on the 27th
of February, 1862, this ill-fated barque was abandoned on the
high seas in a sinking condition.</p>

<p>In 1854 sundry improvements were effected in the extent and
condition of the place, and consisted in part of the erection
of a row of model cottages in Poulton Road, near the entrance
to the town, as well as a new police Station in West Street,
comprising two dwellings for the constables and cells for
prisoners. The streets were also put in better order, and efforts
made to render the aspect of Fleetwood more finished and
pleasing than it had been during the two or three previous
seasons. A scheme for the partial drainage of the town was
proposed at the assembly of commissioners, and arrangements
were entered into for the work to be promptly carried out at an
estimated cost of £1,200. Altogether a sudden spirit of activity
seemed to have superseded the lethargy or indifference which
lately had been too much visible amongst the inhabitants in all
matters of public interest, and which had already exercised a
serious and baneful influence upon the prospects of the place as a
sea-side resort. In the ensuing year the body of Primitive
Methodists, which had now become rather numerous, chiefly
owing to the prosperity of the fishing trade attracting many
followers of that calling to the port, most of whom were members
of this sect, commenced and completed a chapel in West Street.
Recently it has been found necessary considerably to enlarge the
edifice, in order to furnish more accommodation for the increasing
congregation. Although the erection of this chapel and of
the other buildings mentioned above mark undoubtedly an era
of progress in the history of the town, still we are constrained to
admit that the wants they supplied were not brought about by
the spread of Fleetwood’s reputation as a watering-place. From
the first little had been done to supplement its natural attractions
by laying out elegant promenades, or improving the state of the
Cops or Poulton Road, so as to render them agreeable rural walks
for many who, after a time, grew weary of watching the eddies
and dimples of the river’s current</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">or of daily rambling where the receding waves left a broad floor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
of firm, unbroken sands. True, a carriage-drive and foot-way of
some pretensions to beauty had been constructed along the north
shore in 1845, but the storms we have described, and other
heavy seas, had torn breaches in its wall, and made sad havoc
amongst its light sandy material, completely ruining the fair
appearance of the shoreward grass-plat, and threatening the
road with that very destruction which has since overtaken it
through the continued negligence of the residents or governing
powers. There was no public hall, such as that once contemplated,
where a feeling of fellowship might be engendered amongst the
visitors. The regattas instituted for the interest and amusement
it was hoped they would excite amongst the spectators were, as
previously stated, conducted in a desultory manner for a few
years, and then abandoned; whilst the land sports during the
week of high festival were discontinued as the Whit-week
excursion trains found other outlets more attractive than Fleetwood
for their pleasure-seeking thousands; but it was not until
the North Euston Hotel was opened for military purposes, that all
hope of reviving the fading reputation of the town as a summer
resort was finally relinquished. For some little time after the foregoing
transfer, the bathing vans, as if to keep up the fiction of the
season, re-appeared with uninterrupted regularity each year upon
the beach, but even that last connecting link between the deserted
town, as far as visitors were concerned, and its former popularity,
was doomed shortly to be broken, for the ancient machines, never
renewed, and seldom repaired, were at length unequal to the
rough journey over the cobble stones, and crumbled to pieces on
the way, expiring miserably in the cause of duty, from old age
and unmerited neglect.</p>

<p>In the early part of 1859, a lifeboat, thirty feet in length, was
stationed here by the National Lifeboat Institution, and in the
month of September in the same year, a neat and substantial
house was built for it on the beach opposite the North Euston
Hotel. After doing good service along the coast, in rescuing
several crews whose vessels had stranded amidst the breakers on
the outlying sand-banks, this boat was superseded, in 1862, by
one of larger dimensions. In January, 1863, the erection on the
beach was swept away by the billows during a heavy gale, and in
the course of a few months the present structure in Pharos Street,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
far removed from the reach of the destructive element, was raised,
and the lifeboat transferred to its safer keeping.</p>

<p>The census of the residents taken in 1861 showed a total of
4,061 persons, being an increase of 940 over the number in 1851,
and of 1,228 over that in 1841. Hence it is seen that during the
long period of twenty years, almost from its commencement to
the date now under consideration, through fluctuating seasons of
prosperous and depressed trade, the town had succeeded in adding
no more than 1,228 individuals to the roll of its inhabitants,
many of whom would be the offspring of the original settlers.
Truly the foregoing picture is not a very satisfactory one to
review when we call to mind the bright auspices under which the
place was started,—the early and ample railway accommodation,
the short and well-beaconed channel, and the safe and spacious
harbour; but could we only add the extensive area of docks, the
Fleetwood of 1871 would doubtless have presented a widely
different aspect to that we are here called upon to portray. It
is scarcely just, however, to lay all the burden of this slow rate of
progress on the want of suitable berth provision for heavily-laden
vessels coming to the harbour. Fleetwood had other means of
extending its circle besides those derived from its happy situation
for shipping trade. Its merits as a watering-place were allowed on
every hand; eulogistic versions of its special charms were circulated
through the public prints; strangers flocked each summer to its
shores, and were enchanted with their visits; but after a while the
refreshing novelty wore off, and the puny efforts made by those
whose interests in the prosperity of the town were greatest, failed
to fill the inevitable void the waning newness left in its train. In
the meantime other season places, urged on by emulation,
enhanced the beauties of nature by works of art; promenades,
walks, drives, and, at no distant period, piers, were constructed
to meet the popular demands, and in that way the
tide of visitors was turned from the non-progressive and now
over familiar attractions of Fleetwood to swell the annually
increasing streams which overflowed the rising towns of Blackpool
and Lytham. The year 1861 will ever be remarkable in the
history of Fleetwood as being the date at which the town was for
the first time practically diverted from that line of progress which
its founder, in too sanguine expectancy, had early marked out for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
it. Its decadence as a summer resort had been too pronounced to
allow of any hope being entertained that a revulsion was probable,
or even possible, in the feelings and tastes of the multitude, which
would again people its shores, during the warm months, with a
heterogeneous crowd of valetudinarians and pleasure-seekers. The
noble hotel which had been erected by Sir P. H. Fleetwood on
the northern margin of the shore, in a style of architecture and at
an expense which bore witness to the firm confidence of the
baronet in the brilliant future awaiting the infant town, had been
sold to Government, as previously stated, in 1859, but it was not
until two years afterwards that the first detachment of officers
took up their quarters in the newly-established School of
Musketry, and Fleetwood awoke to the novel sound of martial
music and the reputation of being a military centre. Rumour,
also, had for several months been active in circulating a report
that the sward lying between the Landmark and the cemetery,
and a field at the corner of Cemetery Road, had attracted the eye
of Government as a suitable locality whereon to place barracks
and lay out a rifle-practice ground; and in February, 1861, doubt
on the subject was no longer admissible, for the contract to carry
out the fresh project was let during that month to the gentleman
who had been engaged in the necessary alterations at the North
Euston Hotel. The scheme involved the creation of residential
accommodation in the field just indicated for a small force of 220
men and 12 officers, some of the quarters being specially designed
for married soldiers, in addition to which lavatories, a canteen,
mess-room, magazine, and guard-house, were to be erected. The
work was entered on without delay, and at no long interval, about
ten months, or rather more, the whole of the buildings were completed,
and soon afterwards occupied. The practice-ground was
marked out for range firing, and butts provided, where the
targets were shortly stationed. A spacious hospital, it should be
mentioned, was constructed almost contemporaneously with the
main portion of the barrack buildings.</p>

<p>On Monday, the 20th of May, 1861, a mass meeting was
convened to ascertain the opinion of the inhabitants with regard
to a claim of exclusive use of the road over the Mount-hill, which
had recently been set up by Sir Peter Hesketh Fleetwood, who in
order to establish his right had caused a cobble wall to be erected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
round that portion of the estate. The meeting, consisting of
about three hundred persons, was held on the pathway in dispute,
which crosses the highest point of the elevation. A platform was
raised, and a chairman, elected by the unanimous voice of the
company, ascended the rostrum, being accompanied by several of
the more enthusiastic advocates of free-road, who in the course of
earnest addresses declared that for twenty years the Mount had
been dedicated to the public service, in consideration of certain
sums paid annually to the lord of the manor out of the town’s
rates, and that having been so long the property of the people,
Sir P. H. Fleetwood had now no moral or legal title to wrest it
from them. The ardent language of the speakers aroused a
sympathetic feeling in the breasts of the small multitude, and
murmurs of discontent at the attempted deprivation of their
privileges had already assumed a threatening tone, when a
gentleman who happened to be visiting the neighbourhood,
appeared upon the scene, and in a few spirited words urged the
excited listeners to some speedy manifestation of their disapproval.
Uttering a shout of indignation and defiance the crowd rushed at
the enclosure wall, tore down the masonry, and quickly opened
out a wide breach through the offending structure, after which
they filled the air with triumphant cheers and shortly retired
homewards in a comparatively orderly manner. In the course
of a few months the vexatious question was settled between the
representatives of the town and Sir P. H. Fleetwood, who on his
part agreed only to retain to himself a plot of land fifty yards
square, lying on the west side of the hill; another piece one
hundred yards square, extending from the base of the elevation to
the sea; the wooden edifice on the summit of the mound; six
square yards whereon to erect a look-out house for the Coastguards;
and the gardens and cottage-lodges at the entrance. The
remainder of the Mount, amounting to about three-fourths, was
given up to the public, together with the right of footway through
the cottages just mentioned, and over the east and west plots;
the commissioners engaging, on their side, to erect and maintain
a suitable fence round the Mount, and to keep the hill itself in a
proper manner for the benefit of the inhabitants or visitors, as
well as binding themselves upon no account to raise any building
on the site. The entire ground, with the buildings, has since<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
been given, on much the same conditions, to the town.</p>

<p>During the year 1862 the town, which for some time had lain
dormant in a commercial point of view, evinced unmistakable
signs of returning animation; trade was more active, rumour once
more hinted at the probable commencement of docks at an early
date, and ninety-five houses of moderate size were erected. In
the earlier half of the following twelve months no less than
thirty-seven more dwellings were added to the town, the foundations
of several others being in course of preparation. A branch
of the Preston Banking Company was also opened for a few hours
once in each week; and during later years has transacted business
daily.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, the 20th of January, 1863, a storm and flood, such
as has seldom been witnessed on this coast, arose suddenly and
raged with fury for about twenty hours. The whole of the wall
under the Mount, which had been brought to light by some gales
in the previous November, after having been buried in the sand
for long, was utterly demolished, not one stone being left upon
another. In addition, the breakers penetrated with destructive
violence, several yards inland beyond the line of that barrier
throughout its whole length, from the west end of the Euston
Barracks to the further extremity of Abbot’s Walk. A wooden
battery of two 32-pound guns at the foot of the Mount, belonging
to the Coastguards,<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> and used for training the Naval Volunteer
Reserve, was undermined and so tilted that its removal became a
necessity. The marine fence, which had been constructed at an
immense cost, between the Landmark and Cleveleys, was almost
entirely swept away, leaving the adjacent country open to the
inundations of the sea, which rushed over and flooded all the land
between the points just named, extending eastward even to the
embankment of the Preston and Wyre Railway. Several of the
streets at the west side of Fleetwood were under water, as also
were the fields about Poulton road and the highway itself. The
proprietor of the “Strawberry Garden,” off the same road, and his
family, were compelled to take refuge in an upper storey of their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
dwelling until rescued in a boat, the following day, from their
unpleasant, if not perilous, position. It was in this hurricane that
the house erected on the shore for the reception of the lifeboat
suffered annihilation, and the boat itself narrowly escaped serious
damage. Tuesday, the 10th of March, in the same year was
observed by the residents as a general holiday and gala day, in
honour of the marriage of Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, with the
Danish Princess, Alexandra. Flags and banners floated from the
windows of nearly every habitation, as well as from the roofs of
many, while the steamships and other vessels in the harbour were
gaily decorated with bunting, which waved in rich and varied tints
from their masts, spars, and rigging. Triumphal arches of the
“colours of all nations” were suspended across the streets at several
points. A large procession of schools and friendly societies in full
regalia, with their banners and devices, paraded the different
thoroughfares, and were afterwards sumptuously entertained, the
latter at their various lodges, and the former in the large area
of a cotton warehouse, recently built on the quay by Messrs. B.
Whitworth and Bros., of Manchester. The military stationed at
the School of Musketry evinced their loyalty by discharging a
<i>feu de joie</i> on the warren. In the following November a scheme
was proposed for the construction of a coast railway between
Fleetwood and Blackpool, to pass through Rossall and Bispham.
A survey was made of the route, and according to the plans drawn
out, the projected line was intended to have its Fleetwood terminus
at the south extremity of Poulton Terrace, opposite the end of West
Street, whence it was to run towards the new barracks, near the
cemetery, then diverge to the south in the direction of Rossall.
From Rossall its course lay towards Bispham and thence onwards
to the Blackpool terminus, which would be located in Queen’s
street, adjoining the station already standing there. The stations,
besides those at the two termini, were to be placed at the
barracks, Rossall, and Bispham. At Fleetwood the promoters
proposed to form a junction with the Preston and Wyre Railway
near the old timber pond, for the purpose of passing carriages
from one line to the other, whilst at Blackpool a similar object
would be effected with the Lytham and Blackpool Railway by
deviating eastward from Queen Street, so as to avoid the town,
and establishing a junction with the latter line near Chapel Street.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
On an application being made to parliament for powers to carry
out the design, strenuous opposition was offered by the representatives
of the Preston and Wyre Railway, who pledged themselves
to erect additional stations along their track to accommodate the
people residing at Rossall, Cleveleys, and Bispham, in consequence
of which the bill for a coast-line was thrown out and the project
abandoned.</p>

<p>On the 4th of December, 1863, the Lancaster Banking Company
established a branch here; and on the 15th of that month the
Whitworth Institute in Dock Street was publicly opened. This
handsome Hall was erected through the munificence of Benjamin
Whitworth, esq., M.P., of London, who for long resided at Fleetwood,
and during that period, and afterwards, was instrumental in
giving a marked stimulus to the foreign trade of the port by
shipping each year, on behalf of the large firm of which he is the
head at Manchester, numerous cargoes of cotton from America <i>viâ</i>
Fleetwood. The building is in the Gothic style of architecture. The
walls are built of bricks with stone dressings, the principal features
being the ten arcaded windows, with the stone balcony beneath
running across the entire width of the front, and the elegant entrance.
The interior comprises a spacious reading room and library, a
smoking and coffee room, provided with chess and draughts, an
assembly room, capable of containing 400 persons, and two billiard
rooms. At the time of its presentation to the inhabitants the
donor generously provided tea urns and other appliances necessary
for holding soirees, in addition to having liberally furnished the
whole of the building, including the gift of a choice and extensive
selection of books, chess and draught-men, a bagatelle-board, and a
billiard-table. The second billiard-table was added out of the surplus
funds in 1875. The Institute is vested in trustees for the use of
the town, and governed by a committee chosen from amongst the
subscribers.</p>

<p>During 1864-5 building continued to progress, but not with
that great rapidity which had characterised its advance in 1862
and the earlier months of the following year. An act of
parliament was granted in 1864 to certain gentlemen for the
formation of a dock in connection with the harbour, confirming
the rumour which had now agitated the place for the last two
years, and bringing conviction to the hearts of many of the older<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
inhabitants, whose past experience had taught them to look with
eyes of distrust on all reports which pointed to such a happy
realisation of their youthful dreams. The inaugural ceremony of
breaking the turf did not, however, take place for some time, and
will be noticed shortly. On the 17th of May, 1866, the foundation
stone of the present Roman Catholic church in East Street was
laid by Doctor Goss, bishop of Liverpool, who performed the
ceremony, attired in full ecclesiastical robes, and attended by a
numerous retinue of priests and choristers. The sacred edifice
was opened on Sunday, the 24th of November in the ensuing year.
Its general style is early English of the 13th century. The
building consists of a nave and two aisles, with an apsidal
sanctuary at the east end; it is about one hundred feet long,
thirty-five feet wide, and fifty feet in height. The exterior is
built of stone, the body of the walls being Yorkshire parpoints,
whilst the dressings are of Longridge stone. Mr. T. A.
Drummond, of Fleetwood, was the builder, and the design
was drawn by E. Welby Pugin, esq., architect, the total cost
being about £4,000.</p>

<p>For many years, in fact ever since steamship communication
had been established between this port and Belfast, large quantities
of young cattle from Ireland were landed each season at
Fleetwood, and carried forward by rail to the markets of Preston
and elsewhere. For the benefit of the dealers, who would thus
escape the railway charges, as well as for the convenience of the
graziers and other purchasers residing in the neighbourhood, it
was determined to open a place for the public sale of such live
stock at Fleetwood; the necessary authority was obtained from
the Privy Council, and on the 2nd of April, 1868, the Cattle
Market, lying on the east side of that for general produce, and
consisting of sixteen large strong pens, arranged in two rows with
a road between them, was used for its earliest transactions and
much appreciated by those who were concerned in the traffic.</p>

<p>Wednesday, the 2nd of June, 1869, will not readily be obliterated
from the memories of the people of Fleetwood. On that day the
first sod of the long expected dock was cut by H. S. Styan, esq.,
of London, the surviving trustee of the estate under the will of
the late Sir P. H. Fleetwood, who died in 1866. The auspicious
event was celebrated with universal rejoicing, in which many-coloured<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
bunting played its usual conspicuous part. A large procession
of the clergy, gentry, schools, and friendly societies,
enlivened by the band of the 80th regiment of Infantry from the
Euston Barracks, and gay with waving banners, accompanied
Mr. Styan to the site where the important ceremony was
performed, and sent forth hearty congratulatory cheers when the
piece of turf had been duly dissected from the ground. With all
apparent earnestness and eagerness, operations were at once
commenced, and for two or three months the undertaking, under
the busy hands of the excavators, made satisfactory progress, when
suddenly several gangs of labourers were discharged, and the
works partially stopped—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“While all the town wondered.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Wonderment, however, was turned to a feeling of disappointment
and chagrin, when it was discovered, a little later, that the closing
year would put a period to the labours at the dock as well as to
its own epoch of time, and that its last shadows would fall on
deserted works and idle machinery. For some reason, which
may fairly be conjectured to have been an incompleted list of
shareholders, the Fleetwood Dock Company determined to
suspend all operations barely six months after they had been
begun, and it is scarcely necessary to inform our readers that the
work was never resumed under the same proprietorship. Two
years subsequently, in 1871, the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway
Company obtained an act of parliament to carry out, on a
larger scale, the undertaking which their predecessors had
abandoned almost in its birth. The dock, which embraces an
area of nearly ten acres, being one thousand feet long, by four
hundred feet wide, has already been in course of formation for
more than two years, and although the labour is being pushed
forward by the contractors, Messrs. John Aird and Sons, of
Lambeth, with as much expedition as is consistent with good
workmanship, the completion of this much-needed accommodation
is not expected until some time in 1877. The dock walls are built
with square blocks of stone, surmounted by a broad and massive
coping of Cornish granite, and filled in behind with concrete, the
whole having an altitude of thirty-one feet, and being placed on a
solid concrete foundation fourteen feet wide. The walls themselves
vary in width as they approach the surface, being in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
lower half of their distance 12½ feet, then 10½ feet, and in the
highest section 8½ feet wide. The lock entrance communicates
with the north extremity of the dock, and is two hundred and
fifty feet long by fifty feet wide, being protected at each end by
gates, opening, respectively, into the dock and the channel now in
process of excavation to the bed of the river Wyre. Lying to
the south of the dock is the recently-constructed timber pond,
covering an area of 14½ or 15 acres, and having a depth of 15 feet.
The pond is connected with the dock by means of a gateway, so
arranged in the southern wall of the latter that two feet of water
will always remain in the former after the tide has ebbed below
the level of its floor. The timber pond has no other entrance
beyond the one alluded to. Sir John Hawkshaw, previously
mentioned in connection with the visit of Queen Victoria to
Fleetwood, is the eminent engineer from whose designs the dock
is being constructed.</p>

<p>The prospect, or indeed certainty, of materially increased trade
when the dock is thrown open has not been without effect upon
the town generally, but its stimulating influence is most remarkable
in the large number of houses which, during the last few
years, have sprung into being. Streets have been lined with
habitations where recently not a dwelling existed, and others have
had their vacant spaces filled in with buildings. Handsome
shops have been erected in Dock Street, East and West Streets,
and other localities, whilst many of the residences in Church
Street have been remodeled and converted into similar retail
establishments. Everywhere there is a spirit of activity visible,
contrasting most pleasingly and favourably with the passive
inertitia which pervaded the place for a considerable period previous
to the commencement of the dock operations. In 1875 the commissioners
determined to do something towards protecting the
northern aspect of the Mount from the devastations of the waves,
whose boisterous familiarity had already inflicted serious injury
on its feeble sandy sides, and seemed disposed, if much longer
unchecked, to reduce the venerable pile to a mere matter of
history. A public promenade, fenced with a substantial wall of
concrete, was laid out at the base of the hill, extending from
near the west extremity of the Mount Terrace to the commencement
of Abbot’s Walk. The damaged side of the mound itself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
has been levelled and sown with grass-seed, so that in course of
time the marine walk will have a lofty sloping background of
green sward, and form the prettiest, as it was doubtless the most
needed, object in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>On the 1st of January, 1875, a number of gentlemen, denominated
the Fleetwood Estate Company, Limited, and consisting of
Sir Jno. Hawkshaw, knt., of Westminster; Thos. H. Carr, J. M.
Jameson, C.E., and Philip Turner, esqrs., of Fleetwood; Capt.
Henry Turner and Sturges Meek, esq., C.E., of Manchester;
Thomas Barnes, esq., of Farnworth; James Whitehead, esq., of
Preston; Joshua Radcliffe, esq., of Rochdale; Samuel Burgess,
esq., of Altringham; William Barber Buddicom, esq., C.E., of
Penbedw, Mold; and Samuel Fielden, esq., of Todmorden;
purchased the lands, buildings, manorial rights and privileges
(including wreckage, market-tolls, and advowson of the church),
of the late Sir P. H. Fleetwood, in and near this town, from the
trustees of his property, for £120,000, subscribed in equal shares.
Although negotiations were satisfactorily concluded in 1874, it
was not until the month just stated that the actual transfer was
effected, and the gentlemen enumerated became lords of the soil.
We must not omit to name that a portion of the Fleetwood estate,
amounting to about 600 acres, lying between the old and present
railway embankments, had been acquired in a similar manner, for
£25,000, in 1871, by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway
Company. Under the new proprietorship leases for building
purposes are sold or let, as formerly, for terms of 999 years.</p>

<p>In closing this account of Fleetwood as a watering-place and
town, and before delineating its career as a seaport, it should be
stated that the census of the inhabitants taken in 1871 yielded
a total of 4,428 persons, of whom 2,310 were males, and 2,118
females; but in the limited period which has elapsed since that
result was obtained the population has grown considerably, and
the increase during a similar interval after any of the previous
official returns cannot be taken as a criterion of the present
numerical strength of the residents.</p>

<p>Fleetwood was started in 1839 as a distinct port with customs
established by an order of the Treasury; subsequently in 1844 it
was reduced to a creek under Preston; then two years later
elevated to a sub-port; and finally in 1849 reinstated in its first<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
position of independence. The iron wharf was completed in 1841,
and is constructed of iron piles, each of which weighs two and
three quarter tons, driven seventeen feet below low water mark,
and faced with plates of the same metal, seven or eight inches
thick, which are rivetted to the flanges of the piles, and filled in
at the back with concrete. The wooden pier, about 400 feet in
length, and abutting on the north extremity of this massive
structure, was finished in 1845, and roofed over shortly afterwards.
On the 22nd of July in the ensuing year, the last stone of the
wharf wall, erected by Mr. Julian A. Tarner, of Fleetwood, and
extending fourteen hundred feet from the south end of the iron
wharf in the direction of the railway, was laid; and at the same
time the coal-shoots connected with the new portion of the quay
were approaching completion.</p>

<p>The improvement of the harbour was entrusted to Captain
Denham, R.N., F.R.S., under whose superintendence the seaward
channel of the river was buoyed and beaconed, being rendered safe
for night navigation by the erection of a marine lighthouse, in
1840, at the foot of Wyre, nearly two miles from the mouth of
the river at Fleetwood. This lighthouse was the first one erected
on Mitchell’s screw-pile principle. The house in which the lightkeepers
lived was hexagonal in form, and measured 22 feet in
diameter, from angle to angle, and nine feet in height. It was
furnished with an outside door and three windows; and divided
within into two compartments, one of which was supplied with a
fireplace and other necessaries, whilst the second was used purely
as a dormitory. The lantern was twelve-sided, 10 feet in diameter
and 8 feet in height to the top of the window, the illumination it
produced being raised about 31 feet above the level of the highest
spring-tide, and 44½ feet above that of half-tide. A few years
since, in 1870, this lighthouse was carried away by a vessel, and
for some time a light-ship occupied the station, but subsequently
another edifice, similar in appearance and construction to the
original one, was raised about two hundred yards south of the
same site.</p>

<p>Captain Denham, having accomplished his survey of the river and
harbour, issued the following report in 1840:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The river Wyre assumes a river character near Bleasdale Forest, in Lancashire,
and after crossing the line of road between Preston and Lancaster, at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
Garstang, descends as a tortuous stream for five miles westward; then, in another
five mile reach of one-third of a mile wide, north-westward, sweeping the
light of Skippool, near Poulton-le-Fylde, on its way, and bursting forth from the
narrows at Wardleys, upon a north trend, into the tidal estuary which embraces
an area of three miles by two, producing a combined reflux of back-water, equal to
fifty million cubical yards, and dipping with such a powerful <i>under-scour</i> during
the first half-ebb, as to preserve a natural basin just within its coast-line orifice,
capable of riding ships of eighteen or twenty feet draft, at <i>low water spring tides</i>;
perfectly sheltered from all winds, and within a cable’s length of the railway
terminus, nineteen miles from Preston, and in connection with Manchester,
Lancaster, Liverpool, and London. It is on the western margin of this natural
dock that the town, wharfs, and warehouses are rising into notice, under the
privilege of a distinct port, and abreast of which, the shores aptly narrow the
<i>back-water escape</i> into a bottle-neck strait of but one-sixth the width of the
estuary, so impelling it down a two-mile channel as scarcely to permit diminishment
of its three and four-mile velocity until actually blended with the <i>cross-set</i> of
the Lune and Morecambe Bay ebb waters. Thus, the original short course of
Wyre to the open sea, is freed from the usual river deposit, its silting matter
being kept in suspension until transferred and hurried forth at right angles by the
ocean stream. It is, therefore, the peculiar feature and fortune of Wyre that,
instead of a <i>bar</i> intervening between its bed or exit trough and the open sea, a
precipitous river shelf, equal to a fall of forty-seven feet in one-third of a mile,
exists.”</p>

</div>

<p>The first steam dredger, of 20 horse power, was launched on
the 21st of January, 1840, and the important work of deepening
and clearing the channel at once commenced.</p>

<p>At a meeting of the Tidal Harbour Commissioners held at the
port on the 21st October, 1845, it was stated that the harbour dues
were—for coasting vessels, 1d. per ton, and for foreign ships, 3d. per
ton; whilst the light charges were in all cases 3d. per ton. At the
same time it was observed that the whole of the dues amounted
in 1835 to £36 2s. 0d., and in 1845 to £528 9s. 5d. (In 1855 the
dues on similar accounts reached £1,520; and in 1875, £2,427.)
The Walney light was reported to be a great tax on vessels
coming to Fleetwood, as they were charged 3d. a ton per year,
commencing on the 1st of January; so that if a vessel arrived at
the port on the 28th of December, a charge was made for the
year just closing, and a further sum demanded from the craft on
going out in the month of January. This was not the case with
regard to similar taxes in other localities, where one payment
exempted a ship for twelve months; and consequently the
regulation acted in some degree as a deterrent to traders, who
might under a more liberal arrangement have been induced to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
have availed themselves in larger numbers of the facilities
offered by the new haven. The total length of useful wharfage in
1845 extended over 1,000 feet, being well supplied with posts and
rings, and possessing no less than sixteen hand cranes, thirteen of
which were for the purpose of unloading vessels at the quay.
There was a depth of five feet at low-water spring tides from the
marine lighthouse, at the foot of Wyre, to the wharf, and it was
proposed to dredge until ten feet had been obtained.</p>

<p>On examining the state of the shipping trade of the harbour
during the year 1845, it is discovered that the imports and exports
of foreign produce and home manufacture, respectively, far outstripped
those of any of the few preceding years. There had been
vessels laden with guano from Ichaboe, sugar from the West Indies,
flax from Russia, and timber from both the Baltic and Canada,
making in all twenty-three ships of large tonnage, only two of which
returned with cargoes, in far from complete stages of fulness, from
the warehouses of Manchester, Preston, or other adjacent commercial
towns. The coasting trade had also given earnest of its progressive
tendencies by a remarkable increase in the number of
discharges and loadings over those of the previous twelve months,
and notwithstanding the four hundred feet of extra wharfage,
forming the wooden pier, just opened, the demands for quay berths
could not always be supplied.</p>

<p>New bonding warehouses were erected towards the close of
1845 at the corner of Adelaide and Dock Streets, the temporary
ones previously in use being abandoned, and comprised three
stories capable of providing accommodation for 400 hogsheads of
sugar at one time, as well as spacious vaults and other conveniences
for duty-bearing articles. The goods allowed to be
warehoused were wine, spirits, tea, tobacco, East India goods,
and goods in general.</p>

<p>In 1846 prosperity continued to reward the efforts put forth by
the authorities of the young haven. Twelve vessels arrived from
America with timber, and nine similarly laden from the Baltic;
tobacco, sugar, and other commodities were imported in two ships
from the Indies; but the event which kindled the brightest
anticipations in the breasts of the inhabitants and others interested
in the success of the port was the arrival of the barque “Diogenes,”
chartered by Mr. Evans, of Chipping, with the first cargo of cotton<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
ever landed at Fleetwood. In it was welcomed an introduction to
the chief trade of the county, and a happy augury of future
activity in an import which would not only of itself materially
assist the financial condition of the harbour, but would also be the
means of spreading its reputation throughout the commercial
world, and extending its field of action to a degree which could
scarcely be foretold. How these pleasant visions have been fulfilled
the reader is perhaps aware, but if not a glance at the tables of
coasting and foreign trade, given a little later, will furnish the
necessary information. On the 12th of February, immediately
the novel consignment just referred to, which “afforded a suitable
opportunity,” had come to hand, a public dinner was given by
their fellow-townsmen to Frederick Kemp and John Laidlay,
esqrs., as a mark of respect for their assiduous efforts to develope
the mercantile resources of the place. During the evening Mr.
Laidlay remarked that “within a short period the trading intercourse
of the port had extended to various and distant portions of
the world, the products of Africa, the West Indies, and North
America having been imported; and stretching our arm still
further, a cargo from the East Indies may be stated as almost
within our grasp.” Mr. Evans, in alluding to his transatlantic
shipment, affirmed that in bringing it by way of Fleetwood, he
had effected a saving of at least a farthing per pound; and continued,—“When
the order was given, it could not have been
imported into Liverpool without loss.”</p>

<p>In the latter part of the year a testimonial was presented by the
inhabitants of the town to Henry Smith, esq., of Fleetwood,
manager of the North Lancashire Steam Navigation Company, as
a tribute to his untiring and successful attempts to promote
steamship traffic and advance the interests of the place, and in the
course of a speech made on the occasion, Mr. Smith said:—“In
1842 I first visited Fleetwood at the request of the London
board of directors, it then presented a most gloomy aspect—a
splendid modern ruin, no shipping, no steamers, no passengers for
the trains, and yet it required no very keen discernment to learn
that all the facilities for trade and commerce existed here, but life
was wanting; here was one of the finest and safest harbours,
certainly the best lighted and marked port on the west coast,
being as easily made by night as by day, with that wonderful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
natural phenomenon, the Lune Deep, making it a safety port to
take in fog by sounding—a thing having no parallel in England....
What changes have we witnessed here since
1842? I have seen your population without employment, and
now there is more work than there are hands to perform—the
wages from one shilling a day have advanced to two shillings and
sixpence and three shillings; then indeed was your port without a
ship, now there is a general demand for more quay room, although
since then upwards of 1,000 feet have been added to the wharfage;
then your railway receipts were £100, this year they have attained
£1,500 per week.” This unfortunate gentleman was killed in
the June following, through a collision on the London and
North Western Railway; and there can be no hesitation in
affirming that, had his career of usefulness and activity not been
thus prematurely cut short, the trade of Fleetwood would have
developed, in the long period which has elapsed since his death,
into something more important than it presents to day.</p>

<p>The following authentic returns of the whole business of the port
in 1846 forms a favourable comparison with those of 1840, the
year in which the railway was opened, when they amounted to
57,051 tons of imports, the exports being proportionately small:—</p>

<p>The animated appearance of the harbour was described in 1846
by a gentleman connected with the town, as here quoted:—“With<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
two Indiamen at their berths, the splendid steamers
alongside, schooners, small craft innumerable dotting the river,
wharfmen, porters, etc., removing merchandise from vessel to
wagon, and <i>vice versa</i>, the cranes in constant operation, goods-trains
arriving and preparing for departure, give the pier-head
and harbour an air of bustle and activity, and are themselves a
pleasing indication of what our commerce may become; of the
trade which vigilance, patience, and effort, may secure to the
harbour and railway.”</p>

<p>The twelve months of 1847 proved anything but a re-assuring
time. The foreign imports suddenly fell off to six cargoes, four of
which were timber from America, the two remaining being guano
and timber from Hamburg. One left for Mexico and Hong Kong,
laden with British goods, silk, wine, and spirits from the bonding
warehouses. The coasting returns also showed a diminution of
almost fifty discharges at the quay, as compared with the previous
year, and a corresponding decrease in the exports; but in spite of
the sudden dispiriting experience, we find from the annexed extract
out of the annual official report concerning the harbour, that the
future was regarded hopefully:—“There is every probability of the
business increasing at this Port, as an extensive trade with the
Baltic is expected, and most of the goods now in warehouse under
bond will no doubt be taken out for home consumption during the
present year.” 1848 was marked by an increase of nine in the
number of foreign importations; and of the fifteen large vessels
which arrived, one was from France with wines and spirits for
re-exportation to Mexico, two were from the Baltic and Hamburg
with timber, eleven from Canada with timber, and one from
Russia with flax. The importers of timber carried on, and used
sedulous efforts to extend, a healthy retail trade in the adjoining
districts and in the west of Yorkshire. The export trade was still
inconsiderable, although gradually increasing, but it was expected,
from the convenient situation of the harbour to the manufacturing
towns, and the local dues upon vessels and goods being much
lower than at other ports, that both it and the imports would,
before many years had passed over, become very extensive, more
especially as the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company had
recently acquired a right to the line between Fleetwood and
Preston, and were offering every facility and inducement to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
shippers and manufacturers, with the view of making this haven
the inlet and outlet for goods to and from the towns and villages
on their several lines. During the twelve months eighteen small
importations of paper from the Isle of Man took place, and it was
necessary for the officers connected with the customs to keep a
strict guard upon the wharf to prevent the smuggling of that and
other dutiable articles by the numerous passenger and coasting
vessels from the above island, as well as from Scotland and Ireland.</p>

<p>In 1849 the foreign imports were more than doubled, the excess
being chiefly due to the increase of timber-laden vessels. Six of
the total number sailed outwards with cargoes of warehoused
goods, and nine with coal and salt. The coasting trade underwent
a most remarkable rise of about four hundred cargoes inwards, and
two hundred outwards, the principal of the former being iron ore,
pig iron, and, more occasionally, grain; and of the latter, coal.
The barque “Isabella” discharged 609 bales of cotton at Fleetwood
from America in July, 1850, being the second cargo landed
here, and later in the year another consignment of 400 bales was
brought by the same vessel. In 1851 the only novel feature was
the arrival of a large shipload of currants; the value of British
goods exported amounted to £90,000, besides which there were
considerable quantities of merchandise sent outwards from bond.
The main foreign business in 1852 was in timber and dried fruits,
but such importations were seriously diminished during the
ensuing year by the high price of the latter and by a temporary
misunderstanding between the railway company and one of the
chief timber merchants, through which several consignments
intended for the Wyre were diverted elsewhere; in addition five
large cargoes were lost at sea and not replaced. The coasting
trade continued to expand until 1856, when its zenith was reached,
since when it has been characterised by a gradual decline, and
the last report, that of 1875, is as little encouraging as any, with
one exception, of its degenerate predecessors. The fourth freight
of cotton, consisting of 1,327 bales, made its appearance in the ship
“Cleopatra,” in the spring of 1857, and was consigned to Messrs.
Benjamin Whitworth and Brothers, of Manchester, etc. Shortly
afterwards, barely two weeks, the “Favourite” arrived with a
further consignment for the same firm, and gave the signal for
the real commencement of a prosperous trade in that commodity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
with America, which rapidly developed until the outbreak of
civil war in the transatlantic continent brought it somewhat
abruptly to a close in 1862. In a comparative statement of
charges between Liverpool and Fleetwood, issued during that
flourishing time, it was demonstrated that on a vessel of 500 tons,
cotton in and coals out, the following saving in favour of this port
could be effected:—</p>

</table>

<p>Supposing the cargo to have been consigned to parties in
Preston, a further advantage, amounted to £230 0s. 0d. in carriage
would be gained, raising the entire saving to £400 15s. 0d.</p>

<p>During late years, the business firm just alluded to, whose
interests in, and efforts for, the welfare of the port have so long
been unflagging, has made a vigorous attempt to revive the
American cotton importations. For the last few seasons several of
their shipments, about ten, have annually arrived, and there is
every prospect that when the dock is completed many more
vessels will be chartered. A large shed for the reception of cotton
was erected in 1875, in Adelaide Street, by Messrs. B. Whitworth
and Bros., who have also established a permanent office in the
town.</p>

<p>In 1859 the trade between Fleetwood and Belfast had developed
to such an extent that a larger covered area for the temporary
warehousing, loading, and discharging of goods was urgently
called for, and towards the close of that year a space of about 190
feet in length, by 30 feet wide, was walled in and roofed over on
the quay, adjoining the building then in use for the same purposes.
Four years later, in 1863, two steam cranes were placed on the
wharf by the North Lancashire Steam Navigation Company.
Subsequently other cranes, working on a similar principle, have
been added to those experimental ones, and gradually the old
system of hand-labour at the quay-side has been superseded by
the adoption of this more expeditious and economical plan.
Shortly before the last-named facilities had augmented the conveniences
of the wharf, a fresh description of mooring appliance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
was laid down in the harbour, and consisted of two longitudinal
ground chains of 1,000 feet each, attached at intervals of 50 feet to
two sets of Mitchell’s screws, which were worked into the clay in
the bed of the stream. The bridle chains, shackled above to the
mooring buoys, were secured below to the ground links between
the attachments of the screws, the buoys being so arranged that
each vessel was held stem and stern, instead of swinging round
with the tide, or stranding with one end on the large central
sandbank, as heretofore.</p>

<p>From 1862 to the present date, the story of the haven, with
the exceptions of the trawling fleet and the Belfast line, which
will be treated of directly, is not one which will awaken envy in
the breasts of those whose interests are bound up in rival ports,
nor indeed can it be a source of congratulation to those whose
interests might ordinarily be supposed to be best promoted by its
prosperity. It is true that the foreign trade for seven years after
1862 was in a state of fluctuation rather than actual decline, but
the three succeeding years were stationary at the low figure of
21 imports each, after which there was a slight improvement,
raising the annual numbers to 24, 32, and, in 1875, 33, due more
to the staunch allegiance of Messrs. B. Whitworth and Bros.,
whose cotton again appeared on the wharf, than to any inducements
offered to them or others by increased facilities or more
appropriate accommodation. The coasting trade has already been
referred to, so that there is no necessity to recapitulate facts but
just laid before our readers. It is proper, however, to mention a
few statistics respecting the trade in exports of coal, the chief
business, and below are given the numbers of tons shipped, mostly
to Ireland, in each of the specified years:—</p>

<p>The large and sudden increase from 1869 is mainly owing to
several screw steamships having been extensively engaged in the
traffic, and there is every probability, from the addition within
the last few months of a new and handsome coal-screw, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
other indications, that this branch of commerce will continue
to develope with equal, if not greater, rapidity. Again, it
should be remembered, when considering the falling off in the
numerical strength of the coasting vessels trading here, that
those now plying are of much greater carrying capacity than
formerly, and consequently the actual exports and imports have
not suffered diminution in anything like the same proportion
as the ships themselves. A series of tabular statements of all
the most important and interesting matters connected with the
harbour from the earliest obtainable dates has been prepared
from the official returns made to the custom-house during each
twelve months, and subjoined will be found a list of the vessels
retained on the register as belonging to the port at the end of the

<p>The foregoing tables, taken by themselves, would seem to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
imply that from the year 1868, the business of the place had
been characterised by a rapid and most satisfactory increase, but
unfortunately for such a deduction, the ships registered as
belonging to any port afford no clue to the number actually
engaged in traffic there, hence it happens that many vessels
hailing from Fleetwood, as their maternal port, are seldom to be
observed in its waters.</p>

<p>The following are the annual records of the foreign and coasting
trade of the harbour, in which the Belfast and all other steamships

<p>Now that the dock is no longer a mere word and promise, but
has at length a definite signification and a material existence,
there is every appearance that those into whose hands the
fortunes of the port may be said to have been entrusted have
no intention of any dilatory action in furthering the interests
of their charge. Already, in 1875, a powerful steam dredger
has been purchased at a cost of £12,000 and set to its labours
in the channel and harbour. This dredger, which has superseded
the older and much smaller one, launched in 1840 and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
used until recently, was built by Simonds and Company, of
Renfrew, on the Clyde, and is of 100-horse power, being capable
of raising 250 tons of sand, shingle, etc., in an hour. In addition
it is able to work in twenty-six feet of water, whereas the original
one was obliged to wait until the tide had ebbed to fourteen feet
before operations could be commenced, so that really the work
which can be accomplished by the new machine is out of all
proportion to that which its predecessor could effect. Several
iron pontoons, or lighters, furnished with false bottoms to expedite
the business of discharging them, formerly performed by hand
and spade, have also been obtained; and the bed of the river
seaward from Fleetwood is rapidly being relieved of its superabundance
of tidal deposits and scourings, which is carried by
the lighters beyond the marine lighthouse at the foot of the Wyre
and deposited in the Lune.</p>

<p>Steamboat traffic was, and is, the most important branch of
shipping connected with the port, but notwithstanding the
support and encouragement which has been so freely extended to
the Belfast line, sundry attempts by the same company to
establish sea-communications between Fleetwood and other places
have invariably ended in complete failures. In the context we
have endeavoured to trace a brief outline of the steamship trade
of the harbour from its earliest days up to our time. The North
Lancashire Steam Navigation Company was established in 1843,
and commenced operations by running the “Prince of Wales”
and the “Princess Alice,” two large and fast iron steamships for
that date, between this port and Belfast on each Wednesday and
Saturday evening, the return trips being made on the Monday
and Friday. In that year, however, the number of trips was
increased to three per week, the fares for the single journey
being, saloon, 15s.; and deck, 3s. Another steamship the
“Robert Napier,” of 220 horse-power, sailed also from Fleetwood
in 1843, every Friday morning, at 10 a.m. for Londonderry,
calling at Portrush, and returned on Tuesday, the fares
being, cabin, 20s.; and deck, 5s. In 1844 we find that communications,
through the exertion and enterprise of the above
company, were open between Fleetwood and Belfast, Londonderry,
Ardrossan, and Dublin, respectively. The Ardrossan line consisted
of two new iron steamboats, “Her Majesty,” and the “Royal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
Consort,” each of which was 300 tons register, and 350 horse-power,
the fares being, cabin, 17s.; and deck, 4s. The Dublin
trip was performed once, and afterwards twice, a week each way,
by the iron steamship “Hibernia,” which called off Douglas, Isle
of Man, to land passengers, but after a year’s trial this communication
was closed. In the summer of 1845, an Isle of Man line was
opened by the steamship “Orion,” which ran daily, except
Sundays; and at the same season the Belfast boats commenced
to make the double journey four days a week, whilst the Londonderry
route was abandoned. As early as 1840, on the completion
of the Preston and Wyre Railway, a daily steam communication
had been established to Bardsea, as the nearest point to Ulverston
and the Lakes; and in the month of September, 1846, on the
completion of Piel Pier, it was transferred to that harbour,
and continued by the steamship “Ayrshire Lassie,” of 100 horse-power,
the fares being, saloon, 2s.; and deck, 1s. In the
following year this boat was superseded by a new steamer, the
“Helvellyn,” of 50 tons register and 75 horse-power, which
continued to ply for many years, in fact, almost until this summer
line was closed, at a comparatively recent date, about eight or ten
years ago. The Fleetwood and Ardrossan steamers discontinued
running in 1847, and at the same time an extra boat, the
“Fenella,” was placed on the Isle of Man route, whilst the Belfast
trips were reduced to three double journeys per week. After a
few years experience the Isle of Man line, a season one only, was
given up; but the Belfast trade, continually growing, soon obliged
the company to increase the number of trips, and step by step to
enlarge and improve the boat accommodation. We need not
trace through its different stages the gradual and satisfactory
progress of this line, but our object will be sufficiently attained by
stating that the two steamships were shortly increased to three.
Afterwards larger and finer boats, having greater power, took the
places of the original ones, and at the present day the fleet
consists of four fine steamers of fully double the capacity of the
original ones, which cross the channel from each port every
evening except Sunday.</p>

<p>In the year 1874 the whole of the interests of Frederick
Kemp, esq., J.P., of Bispham Lodge, in the Fleetwood and Belfast
steam line were acquired by the Lancashire and Yorkshire and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
London and North Western Railway Companies, at that time
owners of the larger share, and now practically sole proprietors.
Up to the date of this transaction the vendor had been intimately
and personally associated with the traffic as managing-owner
from its first institution, in addition to which he was the chief
promoter of the Ardrossan and Isle of Man routes.</p>

<p>With the solitary exception of the service whose progress has
just been briefly traced out, there is perhaps no single branch of
industry which has assisted so ably in maintaining and stimulating
such prosperity as the town of Fleetwood has enjoyed,
throughout its chequered career, as the fishing traffic. In the
earliest years of the seaport, shortly before the Belfast steamer
communication was established, a second pilot boat, named the
“Pursuit,” arrived in the river from Cowes, but finding little
occupation the crew provided themselves with a trawl-net and
turned their long periods of vigil to profitable account by its use.
This sensible plan of launching out into another field of labour
when opportunities of prosecuting their more legitimate avocation
failed them was not of long duration, probably no more than a
few months, for on the Irish line of steamships commencing to
ply the pilots secured berths as second officers, and their boat was
laid up. The “Pursuit” soon became a tender to a government
ship engaged in surveying; and about ten or twelve months later
was purchased by some gentlemen, denominated the Fleetwood
Fishing Company, and, together with four more boats, hired from
North Meols, Southport, sent out on fishing excursions. At the
end of one year the hired sloops were discharged, and five
similar craft bought by the company, thus making a fleet of six
smacks belonging to the place, connected with the trawling trade.
In the course of three or four years the whole of the boats were
sold, as the traffic had not proved so remunerative a venture as at
first anticipated; and one only remained in the harbour, being
purchased by Mr. Robert Roskell, of this place. Shortly afterwards
a Scotch smack arrived from Kirkcudbright, and in about
twelve months the two boats were joined by three or four from
North Meols, owned for the most part by a family named
Leadbetter, which settled here. Almost simultaneously another
batch of fishing craft made its appearance from the east coast and
took up a permanent station at Fleetwood. The success which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
attended the expeditions of the deep-sea trawlers was not long in
being rumoured abroad and attracting others, who were anxious to
participate in an undertaking capable of producing such satisfactory
results. Year by year the dimensions of the originally small fleet
were developed as new-comers appeared upon the scene, and added
their boats to those already actively prosecuting the trade. To
trace minutely each gradation in the prosperous progress of this
line of commerce would be wearisome to the reader, and is in no
way necessary to the object we have in view. It will be sufficient
for the purpose to state that in 1860 the number of fishing smacks
on the Fleetwood station amounted to thirty-two, varying in
tonnage from 25 to 50 tons each and built at an average cost of
£500 each, the lowest being £400 and the highest £1,000. The
following will illustrate the plan by which men in the humble
sphere of fishermen were enabled to become the proprietors of
their own craft: A shipmaster supplied the vessel on the
understanding that £100 was deposited at once, and the remainder
paid by quarterly instalments, no insurance being asked for or
proffered regarding risk. The arrangement entered into by the
smack-owners for the conveyance of fish to shore, when they
were engaged out at sea in their calling was most simple and
business-like. The boats kept company during fishing, and on a
certain signal being given one of the number, according to a
previous agreement, received the whole of the fish so far caught
by her fellow craft and returned home, for which service her men
were paid 2s. each by the other crews, who continued their
occupation and arrived in harbour generally on Friday. For the
next week another smack was selected, and thus all in turn
performed the mid-week journey. At present there are no less
than eighty-four sloops belonging to this port, pursuing the
business of fishing, and the arrangements both for their purchase
and the landing of the captured fish have undergone a revolution.
All boats are now paid for when they leave the shipbuilder’s yard,
and the former custom of a mid-week relief, has been relinquished,
each sloop returning and discharging as occasion requires. A
fishing boat’s crew usually consists of four men and a boy. In conclusion
it should be noticed that a special warehouse, about 90 feet
long, was erected in 1859, solely for the use of the fishermen and
agents, or dealers, connected with the trade.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Torentum, or Thornton, was estimated in the time of
William the Conqueror to contain six carucates of
land fit for the plough, but this computation was
exclusive of Rossall and Burn, which were valued
at two carucates respectively, so that the whole townships held ten
carucates, about one thousand acres of arable soil, or farming
land, a large amount for those days, but insignificant indeed when
we recall the nine thousand seven hundred and thirty acres
embraced by the township at present, either in use for grazing
and agricultural purposes, or forming the sites of town and village
buildings.</p>

<p>Thornton was held immediately after the Conquest by Roger
de Poictou, and subsequently by Theobald Walter, after whose
death it passed to the crown.</p>

<p>During the reign of King John, Margaret Wynewick held two
of the six carucates of Torentum, or Thornton, in chief from that
monarch, and her marriage was in his gift. In 1214-15
Baldewinus Blundus paid twenty marks to John for permission
to espouse the lady and gain possession of her estate.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> The
request was granted conditionally on Blundus obtaining the
consent of her friends; and in this he appears to have been
successful, for we learn from a writ to the warden of the Honor
of Lancaster in 1221, that Michael de Carleton paid a fine of ten<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
marks to Henry III. at that date for having married Margaret,
the daughter and heiress of William de Winewick, without the
royal assent, and for marrying whom Baldewinus Blundus had
formerly paid twenty marks to King John.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>In 1258, Margaret de Carleton still retained her lands in
Thornton in her maiden name of Winewick,<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> and it is probable
from that circumstance that her second husband was then dead,
for the writ cited above expressly commanded that her inheritance
should be handed over to Michael de Carleton, the penalty
of ten marks for his disobedience having been received.</p>

<p>According to the <i>Testa de Nevil</i>, Matilda de Thorneton, a
spinster, whose marriage also lay in the king’s gift, held lands in
Thornton, of the annual value of twenty shillings; and later,
about 1323, a moiety of Thornton was held by Lawrence, the son
of Robert de Thorneton, a member of the same family. In 1346,
John, son of Lawrence de Thorneton, held one carucate of land
in Thornton and Staynolfe, lately of Robert Windewike, in
thanage, paying yearly at four terms thirteen shillings relief,
and suit to the county and wapentake.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> In 1421 John de Thornton
died, possessed of half the manor of Thornton and the
Holmes, which descended to his son, William de Thornton, who
died in 1429, aged thirty years, leaving four daughters—Agnes,
afterwards the wife of William Wodey; Katherine, who married
William Carleton; Elizabeth, the wife of Robert Adlington;
and Johanna, who espoused Christopher Worthington.<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> Much
as it is to be regretted, no more than the scanty information here
given can be discovered concerning the Thorntons, of Thornton;
even tradition is silent on the matter of their residence or local
associations, although it is very likely they occupied Thornton
Hall, a mansion long since converted into a farm house, and
consequently we are obliged to dismiss with this brief notice what
under more favourable auspices would probably have proved one
of the most interesting subjects in the township. In 1292 the
king’s attorney sued Thomas de Singleton for the manor of
Thornton, etc., but the defendant pleaded successfully, that he
only held a portion of the manor, Thomas de Clifton and
Katherine, his wife, holding the third of two parts of twelve<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
bovates of the soil.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> In the seventeenth year of the reign of
Edward II., William, father of Adam Banastre, who granted
certain concessions to the prior of Lancaster, held, half the vill of
Thornton, the other half being held, as before shown, by
Lawrence de Thorneton.</p>

<p>In an ancient survey of the Hundred of Amounderness, completed
in the year 1346, it is stated that the following gentlemen
had possessions in the place called Stena, or Stainall, in Thornton,
at the rentals specified:—John de Staynolfe held four oxgangs of
land, at four shillings and sixpence;<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> Roger de Northcrope, one
messuage and one oxgang, at sevenpence halfpenny; Sir Adam
Banastre, knt., five acres, at fourpence; Thomas, the son of Robert
Staynolfe, one messuage and one oxgang, at sevenpence halfpenny;
William Lawrence, a fourth part of an oxgang, at sixteen
pence; Thomas Travers, a fourth part of an oxgang, at sixteen
pence; John Botiler, a fourth part of an oxgang, at sixteen
pence; and Richard Doggeson, five acres, at sixpence. William
de Heton held one carucate of land at Burn, in Thornton township,
for which he paid yearly at two terms, Annunciation and
Michaelmas, ten shillings relief, and suit to the county and
wapentake.<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>In 1521, during the sovereignty of Henry VIII., Thomas, earl
of Derby, was lord of the manor of Thornton, which subsequently
passed into the hands of the Fleetwoods, of Rossall, who
retained it until the lifetime of the late Sir Peter Hesketh Fleetwood,
bart., when it was sold. Thornton has for long been
regarded only as a reputed manor. The largest land proprietors
at present are the Fleetwood Estate Company, Limited, and the
trustees of the late John Horrocks, esq., of Preston, but in
addition there is a number of smaller soil-owners and resident
yeomen. Burn Hall is a building of the fifteenth century, and
was occupied in 1556 by John Westby, of Mowbreck, the owner.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>
In 1323 the land of Burn was held by William Banastre at a
rental of ten shillings per annum, and about 1346 one carucate of
the same land was held, as already stated, by William de Heton<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
for a similar yearly payment. Within the residence of Burn was
a domestic chapel, over the doorway of which stood a polished
oaken slab or board inscribed—“Elegi abjectus esse in domo Dei
mei, magis quam habitari in tabernaculis peccatorum.”<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> The
walls were panelled with oak and carved with shields and foliage,
whilst the ceiling was embellished with representations of vine
leaves and clusters of grapes. Modern alterations have destroyed
most, if not all, interesting relics of past ages. After the
death of John Westby, of Burn Hall, a descendant of the John
Westby before mentioned, in 1722, Burn passed to the Rev. J.
Bennison, of London, who had married Anne, his fourth
daughter. It is said that Mr. Bennison utterly ruined his property,
by attempting a style of agriculture similar to that
described by Virgil in his Georgics. Burn Hall is now, and has
been for many years a farm-house, and the estate forms part of
the large tract held by the representatives of the late John
Horrocks, esq. The land lying towards the coast was formerly
subject to occasional inundations of the sea, but an effectual barrier
has been put by raising a mound round such exposed localities.</p>

<p>The extensive area known as Thornton Marsh, was a free
open common, used as a pasture by the poor cottagers of
the township until 1800, when it was enclosed, together with
Carleton Marsh, and has since by cultivation been converted into
valuable and productive fields.</p>

<p>A church and parsonage house were erected at Thornton in
1835, the former being a neat whitewashed building in the early
English style of architecture, with a low square tower, but
presenting externally no special features of attraction beyond its
profuse covering of ivy, which renders it a most picturesque
object in the surrounding landscape. The churchyard also is
well worthy of notice, if only for the luxuriance of its foliage, the
beauty of its flowers, and the taste and elegance exhibited in
several of the monuments. This, like the church and parsonage,
is embosomed in trees. The sacred edifice has been named Christ
Church, and a separate parochial district was assigned to it in
1862, the title of vicar being accorded to the incumbent.</p>

<p>Within the building there is a small gallery at the west end, and
the private pews are arranged in two rows, one being placed along
each side of the body of the church, whilst the central portion is
filled with open benches, or forms, free to all worshippers. A
marble tablet “To the memory of Jacob Morris, a faithful warden
for 20 years, who died Oct., 1871,” is fixed against the south wall,
and over the mantel-piece in the vestry is a white-lettered black
board stating that—“This Church was erected in the year 1835,
containing 323 sittings; and, in consequence of a grant from the
Incorporated Society for promoting the enlargement, building, and
repairing of churches and chapels, 193 of that number are hereby
declared to be free and unappropriated for ever.—David Hilcock
Leighton, minister; James Smith and Richard Wright, churchwardens.”
On the font is the following inscription:—“Presented
to Thornton Church by Elizabeth Nutter, of Rough Hall,
Accrington, July 13th, 1874.”</p>

<p>Mr. James Baines, of Poulton, by will dated 6th of January,
1717, devised to Peter Woodhouse, of Thornton, and six others,
and their heirs, the school-house lately erected by him on Thornton
Marsh, and the land whereon it stood, to be used for ever as a free
school for the children of the township; in addition he
bequeathed to the same trustees several closes in Carleton, called
the Far Hall Field, the Middle Hall Field, and the Vicar’s Hey,
amounting to about twenty-one acres, to the intent, that the
annual revenue therefrom, less 10s. to be expended each year in a
dinner for the trustees, should be devoted to the payment of a
suitable master. In 1806, Richard Gaskell, the sole surviving
trustee, conveyed by indenture to John Silcock, John Hull,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
Thomas Barton, of Thornton, Charles Woodhouse of Great
Carleton, Bickerstaff Hull, and Thomas Hull, and the said Richard
Gaskell, their heirs and assigns, the premises above-mentioned, for
the purposes set forth in the will of the founder.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> A further
endowment of £500 was left by Mr. Simpson, with a portion of
which farm buildings have been erected on the school estate.
The school-house is situated on the east side of Cleveleys Station,
and consists of a small single-storey building, having two windows
and a central doorway in front. To the west end is attached a
two-storey teacher’s residence. The double erection was built
some years ago, by subscription amongst the inhabitants, on the
site of the original fabric at a cost of rather more than £100.
The master is elected and, when necessary, dismissed by the
trustees, who forego their claim on the 10s. left for an annual
dinner. In 1867 the number of scholars amounted to eighty-eight,
fifty-nine of whom were boys, and twenty-nine girls,
presenting about an average attendance since that date.</p>

<p>The small village of Thornton comprises only a limited cluster of
dwellings and the old windmill. The Wesleyan Methodists had
established a place of worship in the township as early as 1812,
and about ten years later the Society of Friends opened a meeting-house
here.</p>

<p>The arable land of Rossall, in Thornton township, or Rushale,
as it was written, is estimated in the Domesday volume at two
carucates. At that time Rossall was included amongst the
princely possessions of the Norman baron, Roger de Poictou,
after whose banishment it passed, by gift of Richard I., to
Theobold Walter, and again reverted to the crown in 1206, on his
demise. King John, at the instigation of Ranulph de Blundeville,
earl of Chester and Lincoln, presented the grange of Rossall to
the Staffordshire convent of Deulacres, a monastic house founded
by that nobleman; and in 1220-1 Henry III. issued a writ to the
sheriff of this county, directing him to institute inquiries by
discreet and lawful men, into the extent of several specified places,
one of which was the pasture of Rossall, recently, “granted by
my father, King John, to the abbot of Deulacres.”<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> In 1227-8 a
deed was drawn up between Henry III. and the abbot whereby<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
the grange was conveyed, or confirmed, to the latter<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>; and twenty
years subsequently a fresh charter appears to have been framed
and to have received the royal signature, for in the following reign
of Edward I., when that monarch laid claim to the land as a
descendant of King John, the head of the Staffordshire convent
produced a document of 31 Henry III. (1247), at the trial, granting
“to God, the church of St. Mary, and the abbot of Deulacres and
his successors for ever, the manor of Rossall with its appurtenances
and with the wreck of the sea.”<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> Sir Robert de Lathum, Sir
Robert de Holaund, Sir John de Burun, Sir Roger de Burton,
Sir John de Cornwall, Sir John de Elyas, and Sir Alan de
Penyngton, knights; Alan de Storeys, Robert de Eccleston,
William du Lee, Hugh de Clyderhou, and Roger de Middleton,
esquires, who composed the jury in the above suit, decided in
favour of the abbot’s title, but at the request of the king’s
attorney, judgment was arrested, and it was pleaded on behalf of
the regal claimant that the abbot’s allegations seemed to imply
that the manor of Rossall was formerly held by the monks of
Deulacres in bailiwick of Kings, John and Henry; that thirty
years at least of the reign of Henry had elapsed before the
predecessors of the present abbot held any fee or free tenement
in the manor, which was worth 100 marks per annum; and
that this rent had been in arrears during the whole of the time;
wherefore the king’s attorney demanded that the accumulation
of these arrears, amounting to 3,000 marks, or £2,000, should
be paid by the abbey to Edward I. The jury stated in their
verdict that the manor had been held by the abbot’s predecessors
as pleaded by the king’s attorney, but that during the last seven
years of King John, and the first twenty-four years of Henry III.,
the manor was only worth 30 marks per annum, and in the
remaining six years before the date of the charter put in as
evidence by the abbot in the first trial, they valued the manor
at 40 marks per annum, on which scales the abbey of Deulacres
was condemned to pay the accumulated arrearages. In 1539,
during the reign of Henry VIII., the grange was valued in the
Compotus of the king’s ministers at £13 6s. 3d. per annum.</p>

<p>The site of the original Hall has long since been washed away<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
by the waves, but in earlier years, before the sea had made such
encroachments on the land, the foundations of red sandstone and
the remnant of an old ivied wall were visible near the edge of the
cliff, all being sufficiently traceable to indicate that the mansion
had been one of no mean dimensions. A coat of arms of the
Fleetwood family, rudely engraven on a flat stone, some ornamental
pinnacles, and other relics of the ancient edifice, have also been
discovered at different times. Numerous foundations of large
buildings were once scattered about the sandy soil of the grange,
but most of them were removed eighty years since as impediments
to the course of the plough. In a plot of ground, known
by the title of “Churchyard field,” remains of a structure, running
east and west, in length thirty and in breadth twelve yards, were
taken up about half a century or more ago by a farmer named
John Ball, who whilst removing them came upon some human
bones. The fabric once standing there was conjectured to have
been a chapel or oratory, and the bones to have been those of
priests or others buried within its precincts. Harrison, in
describing the course of the Wyre, says “that at the Chapell of
Allhallowes tenne myles from Garstone it goeth into the sea,”
and Mr. Thornber suggests, in his History of Blackpool and
Neighbourhood, that the foundations disturbed by Mr. Ball may
have been the remains of the oratory alluded to by the ancient
topographer; but whilst admitting that the character of the relics
discovered points to there having been at one time a religious
edifice on the site, we cannot think that its claims to be the
missing chapel are nearly so great as those of Bispham, which is
now known, by an inscription on an old communion goblet, to
have been actually dedicated to All-Hallows, or at least to have
been commonly designated by that name in the seventeenth
century.</p>

<p>The Allens appear to have held Rossall on lease from the abbot
of Deulacres about a century after the dispute between that
monastery and Edward I. had been decided, for in 1397, during
the reign of Richard II., the name of “Allen of Ross-hall” was
entered in the list of donors to the fraternities of the Preston
Guild of that year. George Allen, of Brookhouse, Staffordshire,
who held Rossall at the date of the Reformation, by virtue of a
long lease granted to his ancestors by an abbot of Deulacres, is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
the earliest of this family to whom these tenants of the grange
can be traced genealogically. The widow and daughters of the
grandson of George Allen were ejected from Rossall in 1583,
before the expiration of their lease, and despoiled of valuable
documents and property by Edmund Fleetwood, whose father had
purchased the reversion from Henry VIII., at the time of the
dissolution of monasteries. On that occasion a neighbour, Anion,
seized and appropriated £500 belonging to the Allens on pretence
of remitting it to Dr. William Allen, at Rheims. Mrs. Allen
made an attempt to recover possession of the grange, and a trial
for that purpose took place at Manchester, but her case broke
down through inability to produce the original deeds and papers,
all of which had been either stolen or destroyed when the Hall
was plundered during the ejection.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> The estate, or grange, of
Rossall, remained in the hands of the Fleetwoods until the
death of Edward Fleetwood, when it passed to Roger Hesketh,
of North Meols, who married Margaret, the only child and
heiress of that gentleman in 1733.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> The Heskeths, of Rossall,
were descended from the Heskeths of Rufford, through Hugh
Hesketh, an offspring of Sir Thomas Hesketh, of Rufford. Hugh
Hesketh married the eldest daughter and co-heiress of Barneby
Kytichene, or Kitchen, and thus acquired a moiety of the manor
of North Meols. At the decease of Hugh Hesketh, in 1625, the
lands of North Meols descended to his son, Thomas Hesketh,
then 56 years of age, whose son and heir, Robert Hesketh,
was already married to the daughter of—Formby, of Formby.
The only child of Robert Hesketh was the Roger Hesketh,
mentioned above, who also held Tulketh Hall and estate. The
Heskeths continued to reside at Rossall until the lifetime of the
late Sir Peter Hesketh Fleetwood, bart.; and under their proprietorship,
at an early period, or in the latest years of their
predecessors, the ancient Hall was pulled or washed down and
another mansion erected more removed from the shore.</p>

<p>In 1843 the design of establishing a school for the education of
the sons of clergymen and other gentlemen, under the direct
superintendence of the Church of England, but at a less cost
than incurred at the public schools then in existence, was first<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
promulgated by the Rev. St. Vincent Beechey, incumbent of
Thornton and Fleetwood; and mainly through the exertions of
that gentleman a provisional committee for arranging details and
furthering the object in view, was formed in the first month of
the ensuing year. This committee consisted, amongst others, of
the Rev. J. Owen Parr, vicar of Preston, chairman; the Revs.
Charles Hesketh, vicar of North Meols; William Hornby,
vicar of St. Michael’s-on-Wyre; John Hull, vicar of Poulton;
R. B. Robinson, incumbent of Lytham; St. Vincent Beechey,
incumbent of Thornton and Fleetwood, hon. sec. <i>pro. tem.</i>; and
Messrs. Thomas Clifton, of Lytham Hall; Daniel Elletson, of
Parrox Hall, and T. R. Wilson-ffrance, of Rawcliffe Hall. At
their first meeting it was decided that the management of the
school should be placed in the hands of a committee of twenty-four
of the principal clergy and laity in the neighbourhood, of
whom fourteen should be clergymen and ten laymen, with power
to fill up vacancies; that the bishop of the diocese should always
be the visitor; that the provisional committee should be the first
members of the council, with which should rest the appointment
of the principal, who must be in holy orders, at such a liberal
salary as would insure the services of one eminently qualified for
so important a post; that the council should have power to
dismiss the principal; that the internal management, subject to
certain regulations, should be committed to the principal, who
should have the appointment and dismissal of all the inferior or
subordinate masters; and that the system of education should
resemble that in the school connected with King’s College,
London, and in Marlborough school, consisting of systematic
religious instruction, sacred literature, classics, mathematics,
modern languages, drawing, music, etc.</p>

<p>With regard to the admission of pupils it was resolved that the
school should consist of not less than two hundred boys; that no
child should be admitted under eight years of age; that the
mode of admission should be by annual payment, nomination, or
insurance; that any pupil should be admitted on the payment,
half-yearly in advance, of £50 per annum for the sons of laymen,
and £40 for the sons of clergymen; that nominations might be
procured, at the first opening of the school, in order to raise
the required capital, whereby pupils could be admitted on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
yearly payment of £40 for the sons of laymen, and £30 for the
sons and wards of clergymen; that a donation of £25, or the
holding of two £25 shares, fully paid up, should entitle the donor
or holder, to one nomination, and a donation of £50, or the
holding of four shares of £25 each, should constitute the donor,
or holder, a life-governor, entitled to have always one pupil in the
school on his nomination; that the shares should be limited to an
annual interest of 5 per cent., and be paid off as soon as possible,
the return of such capital, however, not to destroy the right of
nomination during the life of a governor; that clergymen should
be able to provide for the admission of their children to the
school at a reduced charge of £25 per annum, by paying, on the
principle of life-insurance, small sums for several years previous
to, or one large sum at, the date of entry of each child into the
establishment, such payments to be regulated according to certain
tables, and, of course, forfeited in case the child died.</p>

<p>The committee stated that the outlay of capital required to
erect a building expressly for the purposes of the school would be
greater than they were likely to be able to meet at the low rate of
nomination which it had been deemed expedient to adopt, and,
therefore, it had been determined to take advantage of the offer
of Rossall Hall by Sir P. H. Fleetwood, bart., the mansion being
eminently adapted to the purpose, on account of its size and
situation. It contained many suites of rooms, and an organ
chamber, well suited for a chapel, and furnished with a fine
instrument; and surrounding the Hall were meadows convenient
for play-grounds, and very productive gardens.</p>

<p>The title of the Northern Church of England School was given
to the institution, and on Thursday, the 22nd of August, 1844, it
was formally opened by the Head Master, Dr. Woolley, in the
presence of the junior masters and from forty to fifty pupils, with
their parents. At that date the school-buildings consisted of
apartments in the old Hall for the principal, junior masters, and
lady superintendent; a dining room, 44 feet long and 20 feet wide,
fitted with a general and masters’ tables; four dormitories, able to
accommodate 100 boys; and a chapel, formerly the organ-room
above mentioned, having benches for the scholars and stalls for
the masters, the school-house itself consisting of four lofty rooms,
each about 34 feet long by 20 feet wide, being detached from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
Hall, and fitted up with handsome oak desks and benches,
fixed upon bronzed cast-iron standards. The play-ground comprised
many acres, and in addition there were convenient covered
areas for the recreation of the boys in wet weather.</p>

<p>The school was opened with only 70 pupils, but at the
beginning of the second six months the number had increased
to 115, and the establishment was self-supporting.</p>

<p>The rules of the school have undergone some slight modifications
and additions since they were first framed by the provisional
committee, and no pupils are now admitted under ten or over
fifteen years of age, whilst the annual payments of all pupils
have been raised £20 in each case. The insurance plan of
entrance was never adopted. A donation of 50 guineas now
entitles the donor to a single nomination, and one of 100
guineas constitutes him a life-governor, with power to vote at
all general meetings, and to have always one pupil in the school
on his nomination. Other rules for the internal management
and government of the school have been framed as the number
of scholars has increased and their requirements become greater.</p>

<p>There are three exhibitions connected with this institution, of
£50 a year each, called respectively the Council, Beechey, and
Osborne exhibitions, (the last two being named after the late
Honorary Secretary and the late Head Master, through whose
exertions the funds were mainly contributed,) tenable for three
years at any of the colleges of Oxford or Cambridge; and one of
£10 a year, in books, tenable for three years, and founded by
Lord Egerton, of Tatton. Besides these there are about eight or
ten entrance scholarships offered for competition every year,
ranging in value from £10 to £20 each. Of these seven were
founded by George Swainson, esq., and one by the Bishop of
Rupertsland. A number of other special prizes have been
instituted by the present Head Master, the Rev. H. A. James, B.D.</p>

<p>In 1850 the estate was purchased, and since then fresh buildings
have been erected to provide accommodation for 400 boys. The
old chapel, which was built to supersede the one in the organ-room,
has of late years been converted into a library and class-room.
A dining hall, schools, class-rooms for different branches
of study, spacious dormitories, and a swimming bath have all
been added; whilst extensive enlargements and improvements<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
have taken place in the sanatorium, kitchens, laundries, etc. The
old school has been arranged and fitted up as a lecture-room and
laboratory. The new chapel is a handsome edifice, containing
stained glass windows and a richly decorated chancel; it is
dedicated to the Holy Trinity. It should be added that the
original name,—The Northern Church of England School,—has
been discontinued, and that of Rossall School, substituted, as a
more comprehensive title for a great public school.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carleton</span>, anciently written Carlentun, is named in the
Domesday Book as comprising four carucates of land; and in
the Black Book of the Exchequer, it is stated that during the
reign of Henry II., 1154-89, Gilbert Fitz Reinfred held four
carucates in Carlinton and another place. In 1254 the manor of
Carleton in Lancashire belonged to Emma de St. John, and at
that date there appears to have been some litigation concerning
her right of proprietorship, but how settled we have no means of
discovering.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> In the <i>Testa de Nevill</i> it is recorded that Roger
Gernet had the 24th part, and Robert de Stokeport the 48th, of a
knights’ fee in Little Carleton of William de Lancaster’s fee.</p>

<p>The earliest allusion to the local territorial family occurs in
1221, when Michael de Carleton, as before stated under “Thornton,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
paid a fine to Henry III. for having espoused Margaret Wynewick,
or Winwick, a royal ward, without first obtaining permission from
the king. It has been conjectured that Much Carleton received
its peculiar title from this member of the family, and amongst the
records of some ancient pleadings is one of 1557 concerning certain
lands in <i>Miche Carlton</i>, a mode of writing the name which lends
considerable support to the theory. Alyce Hull, widow, was the
plaintive in the dispute. The Carletons, of Carleton, were
connected with the neighbourhood for a very long period as
holders of the manor; Alicia, the daughter of William de Carleton
married Sir Richard Butler, of Rawcliffe Hall, in 1281, and
received the manor of Inskip as her dowry; and in 1346 H. de
Carleton possessed four carucates and a half in Carleton.<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> Thomas
de Carleton held the manor of Carleton up to the time of his
death in 1500, when he was succeeded by his son and heir George
Carleton, aged 22,<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> who died in 1516, leaving an only child,
William, then eleven years of age.<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> William de Carleton came
into possession of the property on attaining his legal majority,<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>
and died in 1557, being succeeded by Lawrence Carleton, probably
his brother. Lawrence Carleton, who had married Margaret,
the daughter of George Singleton, of Staining, held the estate for
barely twelve months, as he died in 1558 without issue, leaving his
lands and tenements in Carleton, amounting to several extensive
messuages and Carleton Hall, to his only surviving sister, Margaret,
the wife of Thomas Almond.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> Thus Lawrence Carleton was the
last of the manorial family of that name connected with the
township. Of the ancient Hall of Carlton, the seat of the
Carletons for over three centuries, nothing can be learnt beyond
the fact that it stood opposite the Gezzerts farm, and that almost,
if not quite, within the recollection of the present generation some
ruins of the once noble mansion were visible on its former site,
long since enclosed and used for purposes of agriculture. In 1261
the abbey of Cockersand held some property in Carleton, as
appears from an agreement entered into at that date between the
abbot of Cockersand and H. de Singleton Parva, by which the
latter transferred a messuage in Carleton, by the side of other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
messuages already belonging to the abbey, to the abbot, in
exchange for messuages and an acre of ground in the vicinity of
Stanlawe abbey in Cheshire.<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> Stanlawe abbey itself had sundry
possessions in Carleton shortly after its foundation in 1175,<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> all of
which were conveyed to the abbey of Whalley in 1296, when the
two monastic houses were united, and thus it happened that this
township was included amongst the localities in which Whalley
abbey held lands at the time of its dissolution.</p>

<p>Sometime during the reign of Henry VIII. the Sherburnes, of
Stonyhurst, Hambledon, etc., became holders of soil in Carleton,
and at a later period had acquired the manorial rights and
privileges. In 1717 Sir Nicholas Sherburne, bart., bequeathed the
manor of Carleton, amongst numerous other estates, to his only
child and heiress, Maria Winifreda Francisca, the duchess of
Norfolk, and two years later the duke of Norfolk had obtained a
settlement by which he held a life interest in Carleton, Stonyhurst,
and other places, the duchess, however, having reserved to herself
the power to dispose of the reversion or inheritance by will or
deed, executed in the duke’s lifetime. The duchess of Norfolk
bequeathed her real estate, including Carleton, on her death in
1745, to her cousin Edward Weld, esq., grandson of Sir John
Weld, of Lulworth Castle, Dorsetshire, whose descendant Edward
Joseph Weld, esq., has disposed of most of his inheritance in
the township to various purchasers, chiefly amongst the local
yeomanry and gentry.</p>

<p>The Bambers, of the Moor, in Carleton, were people of position
in the township. Richard Bamber, during the latter half of the
sixteenth century, married Anne, the daughter of Thomas
Singleton, of Staining Hall, and consequently was the brother-in-law
of John Leckonby, of Leckonby House, Great Eccleston, who
had espoused Alice, another daughter of the same gentleman.
It is impossible to affirm with certainty what children sprang from
the union of Richard Bamber and Ann Singleton, but of one of
them, Edward, who entered the Romish priesthood, we subjoin an
interesting and tragic account, extracted from the “Memoirs of
Missionary Priests, by the Right Rev. Richard Challoner, D.D.”:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Edward Bamber, commonly known upon the commission by the name of
Reding, was the son of Mr. Richard Bamber, and born at a place called the Moor,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
the ancient mansion-house of the family, lying not far from Poulton, in that part
of Lancashire called the Fylde. Having made good progress with his grammar
studies at home, he was sent abroad into Spain, to the English college at
Valladolid, where he learnt his philosophy and divinity, and was ordained priest.
My short memoirs leave us much in the dark as to many passages and particulars
relating to the life and labours of this good priest, as well as to the history of his
trial; but then short as they are they are very expressive of his zeal and indefatigable
labours, his unwearied diligence in instructing the catholics under his charge,
disputing with protestants, and going about doing good everywhere, with a
courage and firmness of mind almost above the power and strength of man.
When, how, or where, he was apprehended, I have not found, but only this, that
he had lain three whole years a close prisoner at Lancaster castle, before he was
brought to the bar, where he stood with an air of fortitude and resolution of
suffering in defence of truth. Two fallen catholics, Malden and Osbaldeston,
made oath that they had seen him administer baptism and perform the ceremonies
of marriage; and upon these slender proofs of his priesthood, the jury, by the
judge’s direction, found him guilty of the indictment. Whereupon the judge
sentenced him to be hanged, cut down alive, drawn, quartered, etc., as in cases of
high treason. It was on the 7th of August, 1646, that he, with two fellow priests,
and a poor wretch, named Croft, condemned to death for felony, were drawn upon
sledges to the place of execution at Lancaster. There Mr. Bamber exhorted
Croft to repentance, and besought him to declare himself a Catholic, confess
some of his more public sins, and be truly contrite and sorry for all—‘and I,
a priest and minister of Jesus Christ, will instantly in his name, and by his
authority, absolve thee.’ On hearing this the officers of Justice began to storm
but Mr. Bamber held his ground, and finally absolved the man in sight and
hearing of the crowd. As Mr. Bamber mounted up the ladder, he paused after
ascending a few steps, and taking a handful of money from his pocket, threw it
amongst the people, saying, with a smiling countenance, that ‘God loveth a
cheerful giver.’ Mr. Bamber was encouraging Mr. Whitaker, one of the other two
priests about to suffer, who appeared not a little terrified at the approach of death,
to be on his guard against the temptation to save his life by renouncing his
creed, when the sheriff called out hastily to the executioner to dispatch him
(Bamber); and so he was that moment turned off the ladder, and permitted to
hang but a very short time, before the rope was cut, the confessor being still alive;
and thus he was butchered in a most cruel and savage manner.”</p>

</div>

<p>The two following verses, relating to his death, form part of a
long ode or sonnet written at the time:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">“Few words he spoke—they stopp’d his mouth,</div>

<p>The free school of Carleton was founded towards the close of
the seventeenth century. On the 17th of May, 1697, Richard
Singleton, John Wilson, John Davy, and six others recited in an
indenture between them, that Elizabeth Wilson, of Whiteholme,
by her verbal will of the 22nd of September, 1680, declared it to
be her wish that the interest of a fourth of her goods, which
amounted to £59 2s. 0d., should be used by the overseers of
Carleton for the purpose of procuring instruction for so many of
the poorest children of the town of Carleton as they should think
proper; and that one-quarter of her estate had been invested in
land, and the annual revenue therefrom employed according to
her last directions and desire. William Bamber, by will dated
13th of October, 1688, bequeathed £40 to his wife Margaret
Bamber, and Richard Harrison, vicar of Poulton, to the intent
that they should lay out the sum in land or other safe investment,
not to yield less than 40s. per annum, half of which was to be
given, at their discretion, amongst the most needful of the poor
of Great Carleton, and the other moiety to be expended in
purchasing books, or obtaining tuition for such poor children of
the same place as they might select. After the deaths of the two
original trustees, the will directed that the bequest should pass
under the management of the vicar of Poulton, for the time
being, and the churchwarden of Carleton. The money was
invested on the 11th of May, 1689, in a messuage and appurtenances,
a barn, and several closes, called the Old Yard, the Great
Field, the Croft, the New Hey, the Two Carrs, and the third part
of a meadow, named the Great Meadow, all being situated in
Blackpool, and containing by estimation six acres and a half.
The property was immediately leased to the vendor, John Gualter,
at a rental of 40s. a year. By an indenture, dated the 31st of
December, 1706, between Sir Nicholas Sherburne, of Carleton,
Hambleton, and Stonyhurst, and John Wilson, with three others,
of Carleton, it appears that Sir Nicholas leased to the latter, and
their assigns, the school-house, newly erected at a place called
the Four Lane Ends, in Great Carleton, and the site thereof, for a
term of 500 years from the foregoing date, at the nominal rent of
1s. per annum; and John Wilson, with his co-trustees, covenanted
that the same should be used for no other purpose but that of a
school, excepting that Sir Nicholas Sherburne and his heirs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
should have free liberty to hold the courts for the manor of
Carleton within the building. Margaret Bickerstaffe, by her will
of the 19th of April, 1716, left £20, the interest of which she
directed to be employed by her executors in educating some of
the poor children of Carleton. On the 2nd of February, 1737,
Richard Butler and Richard Dickson, trustees for the sale of
certain estates for paying the debts of James Addinson, conveyed
to George Hull, John Sanderson, and others, and their heirs, in
consideration of £42, a close in Thornton, formerly called Rushey
Full Long Meadow, and now Wheatcake, comprising one acre, in
trust, to hold the same and pay the annual proceeds to the master
of the Four Lane Ends school “for his care and pains in teaching
such poor children of Carleton as should be appointed each year
by the chief inhabitants or officers of the township.” The money
seems to have been given by some persons not wishing to disclose
their names, and who selected George Hull, John Sanderson, and
five more, as their agents in the matter, and as first trustees of
the charity. When five of the trustees had died, it was ordained
that seven fresh ones should be elected, and the two remaining be
relieved of their trust. John Addinson, in return for £20, given
by some person, to the inhabitants of Carleton, conveyed to the
same parties a close called the Rough Hey, in Thornton, containing
half an acre, to be dealt with and used as in the previous case.
It is very likely that the £20 here concerned was the sum before
mentioned as the legacy of Margaret Bickerstaffe. All the
premises belonging to the school were vested in six new trustees
by a deed, dated 3rd of June, 1777; and at the visit of the school
commissioners in 1867, the attendance of boys was 50, and of
girls 20, being somewhere about the usual average of later years.
The trustees manage the school property, and appoint or dismiss
the master.</p>

<p>The area of the township embraces 1,979 statute acres.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Meretun</span>, or the town of the Mere, was estimated by the
surveyors of William the Conqueror to comprise six carucates of
arable land, and shortly afterwards Sir Adam de Merton held
half of it, on condition that he performed military service<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
when required.<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> Somewhere about 1200 William de Merton, a
descendant of Sir Adam, was one of the witnesses to a charter,
concerning a local marsh, between Cecilia de Laton and the abbot
of Stanlawe.<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> In 1207-8 the sheriff of Lancashire received orders
to give Matilda, widow of Theobald Walter, her third of the lands
at Mereton, which her late husband had held up to the time of
his death in 1206, at first for 12s. per annum, and subsequently
for one hawk each year.<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> According to the <i>Testa de Nevill</i>,
Henry III. held three carucates of the soil of Mereton for a few
years, as guardian of the heir of Theobald Walter, and in 1249,
during the thirty-third year of the reign of that monarch, Merton
cum Linholme was in the possession of Theobald Walter, or
le Botiler as he was afterwards called, the heir here mentioned.<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>
Marton descended in the Botiler, or Butler, family until the time
of Henry VIII., when it was sold by Sir Thomas Butler to John
Brown, a merchant of London, in company with Great Layton,
of which manor it had for long been regarded as a parcel, although
in 1323, Great Marton was alluded to as a distinct and separate
manor held by Richard le Botiler.<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> Marton was purchased from
John Brown by Thomas Fleetwood, esq., of Vach, in the county
of Buckingham, whose descendants and heirs resided at Rossall
Hall; and after remaining in the Fleetwood family for many
generations the manor of Layton, with its dependency Marton,
was again sold, and this time became the property of Thomas
Clifton, esq., of Lytham Hall, Sir P. H. Fleetwood, bart., being
the vendor.</p>

<p>Little Marton was held in trust by William de Cokerham,
in 1330, for the abbot and convent of Furness,<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> but eight years
afterwards, the manor of Weeton and Little Marton, were held by
James, the son of Edmund le Botiler, earl of Ormond.<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> What
claim James Botiler had to include Little Marton amongst his
possessions in 1338, cannot now be ascertained, but it is certain
that later, at the dissolution of monasteries, it passed to the crown
as part of the fortified lands of Furness Abbey. Subsequently
Little Marton passed to the Holcrofts, and from them, in 1505, to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
Sir Cuthbert Clifton, of Lytham Hall, by exchange. John Talbot
Clifton, esq., of Lytham Hall, a descendant of Sir Cuthbert, and
the son of the late Thomas Clifton, esq., of Lytham, is the present
owner of Great and Little Marton. As the moss and mere of
Marton, perhaps the most interesting objects in the township,
have been fully described in an earlier chapter, devoted to the
country, rivers, etc., of the Fylde, we refer our readers to that
portion of the volume for more detailed information concerning
them. In this place we must content ourselves by stating that
the mere was at one time a lake of no inconsiderable dimensions,
having a fishery of some value attached to it, and that from the
number of trunks of trees, discovered on the clayey soil beneath
the original moss, which extended six miles by one and a half,
there is conclusive evidence that in ancient times the whole of the
wide tract was covered by a dense forest, composed chiefly of oak,
yew, and fir trees. So enormous were some of the trunks
discovered that it was impossible for one labourer to grasp the
hand of another over them. The hamlet of Peel, situated within,
but close to the Lytham border of the township, contains in a
field called Hall-stede, traces of the ancient turreted manorial
mansion of the Holcrofts, of Winwick and Marton,<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> and the
remains of a moat out of which about sixty years ago a drawbridge
and two gold rings were taken. The old lake of Curridmere,
mentioned in the foundation charter of Lytham priory in the
reign of Richard I., was also located in this neighbourhood, the
site being indicated by the soil it once covered bearing the name
of the <i>tarns</i>. A little more than half a century since the <i>tarns</i>
formed nothing but a trackless bog, and beneath its surface a
husbandman discovered the remains of a small open boat, which
had doubtless been used in earlier days on the waters of
Curridmere.</p>

<p>About 1625 the inhabitants of Marton petitioned, that in
conjunction with “Layton, Layton Rakes, and Blackpool,”<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> the
township might be constituted a separate parish, stating in support
of their prayer that the parish church of Poulton was five miles
distant, and during the winter they were debarred by inundations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
from attending that place of worship. This reasonable request
does not appear to have evoked a favourable response from the
parliamentary commissioners, and it was not until more than a
century and a half later that the district had its claims to the
privilege desired practically acknowledged. The church of St.
Paul, in Great Marton was erected by subscription in 1800, and
opened by license the same year, but was not consecrated until
1804. It was a plain, unpretending structure with front and side
galleries, but having neither chancel nor tower, and capable of
holding upwards of 400 worshippers. In 1857 the increase of the
population rendered it necessary to lengthen the church at the
east end, and at the same time a neat and simple tower was added.
Within the tower is the vestry, above which a number of seats
were raised for the Sunday school children, many of whom had
previously, for want of space, occupied forms in the aisles. A
porch was built over the entrance of the church about 1848, and
in 1871 a chancel was erected. Three bells were purchased by
the parishioners, and placed in the tower in 1868, whilst the
present reading desk and pulpit, were the gift of Miss Heywood,
the daughter of Sir Benjamin Heywood, bart., who formerly had
a handsome marine residence at Blackpool. Previous to 1845 the
musical portion of the service was accompanied by two bassoons
and another wind instrument, but about that date they were
abolished, and a barrel organ substituted, which continued in force
until a few years ago, when it was succeeded by the more modern
key organ at present in use. The church of Marton has now an
ecclesiastical district of its own, but was originally a chapelry
under Poulton. A little anterior to the erection of the church
divine service was conducted in the school-house of Baines’s
Charity, Mr. Sawyer being the first appointed minister.</p>

<p>The old parsonage stood on the same site as the present one,
and consisted simply of two cottages united to form one small
residence. In 1846 this house was pulled down, and another,
elegant and commodious, erected in its place, being completed the
following year. Attached to the parsonage are eleven acres of
glebe land.</p>

<p>James Baines, of Poulton, by will dated 6th of January, 1717,
devised unto John Hull and six others, of Marton, their heirs and
assigns, the school-house lately erected by him in Marton, the
land whereon it stood, a messuage or tenement in Warbreck,
containing about six acres, a messuage or dwelling-house in
Hardhorn-with-Newton, with the smithy and two shippons
thereto belonging, and several closes of land in the same township,
called the Sheep Field, the Croft, the Garden, being about
three acres; also the Many Pits, the Debdale, the Cross Butts,
the Wradle Meadow, and the field adjoining its north-west end,
and the Carr, containing twelve and a half acres, to the intent
that the rents arising from the foregoing should after the deduction
of 10s. for an annual dinner to the trustees, be directed to the
maintenance of a master to instruct the children of the township
in the above-mentioned building. The revenue of the school was
greatly impoverished for many years by the expenses of a chancery
suit about 1850, which arose on the question whether the school
should be continued as formerly or be divided, and part of its
income be devoted to the establishment and support of a similar
institution in the adjoining district of Little Marton. The whole
of the funds were defrayed out of the funds of the charity. A
scheme for its regulation was framed in 1863 by the Master of the
Rolls, providing amongst other matters that the school should be
open to Government inspection, but in no way interfering with
its gratuitous character. The commissioner of 1869 reports:—“Sixty-three
children were present on the day of my visit,
of whom fifty-two were girls, who are taught in the same
classes as the boys, and are with them in play hours. The school
being free, no register of attendance is kept. In arithmetic, six
boys (average age 11), and four girls (average age 10½), did fair
papers; the questions of course were simple ones. Grammar and
geography, in which subjects I examined the highest class, were
tolerably good. The girls read well; the boys (as usual) less so;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
spelling was up to the average. The girls are taught to write a
bad angular hand; the master says that it is to please the parents.
He has been in his present position five years, and receives a
salary of £50 a year.” The school property consists of forty
acres of land, producing a gross annual income of about £130.
Both a playground and gymnasium are attached to the school.
There are now two masters. The vicar of Poulton and the vicar
of Marton, <i>ex officio</i>, and five other trustees self-electing, residing
within the township, appoint and dismiss the masters, admit and
expel scholars, appoint an examiner, and regulate the studies.
The chief master must be a member of the Church of England,
and is not permitted to take boarders.</p>

<p>Margaret Whittam, widow, by will dated 26th of July, 1814,
bequeathed to Edward Hull, Richard Sherson, and John Fair,
of Marton, and her brothers, their executors and administrators,
the sum of £40, duty free, in trust, the interest to be applied to
the benefit of the Sunday school in Marton so long as it should
continue to be taught, and in the event of its being abolished, to
use the same income for the relief of such necessitous persons of
the township as received no alms from the poor rate. The
Sunday school established in 1814 is still kept at Marton, and the
master paid, in part from the interest of the legacy, and the
remainder from subscriptions. About twenty years ago between
£200 and £300 were obtained by means of a bazaar, and
expended in the erection of a school building on a piece of waste
land in Marton, for the purpose of providing for the education of
children, both male and female, under the superintendence of a
mistress. At Marton Moss there is another school, used also as a
church, being served from South Shore, which was built a few
years since through the munificence of Lady Eleanor Cicily
Clifton, of Lytham Hall; and at Moss Side, a small Wesleyan
Chapel was erected by subscription about 1871.</p>

<p>Edward Whiteside, of Little Marton, sailor, bequeathed by will,
dated 22nd December, 1721, as follows:—“It is my will, that my
ground be kept in lease, according as my executors shall see fit,
and what spares it is my will that they buy cloth and give it to
poor people that has nothing out of the town; it is my will that
it be given in Little Marton, and if there be a minister that
preaches in Marton, that they give him something what they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
shall see fit: It is my will, that if they can buy land, that they sell
my personal estate, and buy as much as it will purchase: It is
my will, that two acres, which my father hath now in possession,
that when it falls into my hands and possession, that it go the
way above named: It is my mind and will, that my executors
give it when they shall see fit, and I hope they will choose
faithful men, who will act according to themselves; and I
make my well-beloved friends, Anthony Sherson and Thomas
Grimbalson, executors of my last will.”</p>

<p>William Whiteside left by will, dated 1742, £100 to be invested,
and the annual proceeds to be spent in furnishing clothing to
the poor of Marton, not in receipt of parish relief. John Hull,
Thomas Webster, and Robert Bickerstaffe, were the original
trustees of this charity.</p>

<p>John Hodgson, by will dated 25th of September, 1761, devised
his messuage and lands in Marton, and his personal estate, to
John Hull and Richard Whittam, their heirs and assigns, in
trust, to dispose of the same, and after paying his debts and
funeral expenses, to lay out at interest the remainder of the
money so acquired, and devote the yearly income therefrom to
the purchase of meal for poor housekeepers of Great Marton, not
relieved from the town’s rate. The meal to be distributed
annually on the 25th of December. The net amount of the
legacy was £100.</p>

<p>Edward Jolly, of Mythorp, by indenture, dated 13th of February,
1784, conveyed to James Jolly, James Sherson, and Thomas Fair,
their executors and assigns, the sum of £60, to the intent that it
should be placed on good security, and one shilling of the yearly
income derived be expended weekly in bread, to be distributed each
Sunday to those poor persons who had attended divine service in
the morning at the chapel of Great Marton. The deed directed
that the dole should be given at the door of the chapel immediately
after morning service, by the clerk or some other authorised
person, and that in the event of Marton Chapel, which was then
unconsecrated and supported by subscription, being closed for four
successive Sundays, or converted into a Dissenting place of
worship, the bread money should be transferred to the townships
of Great and Little Singleton, and Weeton-cum-Preese; and the
weekly allowance of food be distributed as above at the parochial<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
chapel of Great and Little Singleton. The dole, however, had to
return to Marton chapel as soon as service, according to the
Church of England, was again conducted there. The chapel
alluded to was Baines’s school-house, where it had been the custom
of Edward Jolly to distribute bread each Sunday for several years
previously, and it was with the intention of rendering this practice
perpetual, that the indenture was made. No re-investment of the
money can be legally made without the approval of the minister
of Marton church.</p>

township the three hamlets or villages of Hardhorn, Newton, and
Staining, of which the last only is alluded to in the Domesday
Survey, where Staininghe is mentioned as comprising six
carucates of land in service. The Coucher Book of Whalley
Abbey furnishes much valuable and interesting information
relating to the district of Staining, and from it we find that
sometime between 1175 and 1296 John de Lascy, constable of
Chester, “gave and by this charter confirms to God and the
Blessed Mary, and to the abbot and monks of the Benedictine
Monastery (Locus) of Stanlawe the <i>vill</i> of Steyninges, with all
things belonging to it, in the <i>vill</i> itself, in the field, in roads, in
footpaths, in meadows, in pastures, in waters, in mills, and in all
other easements which are or can be there, for the safety of my
soul and those of my antecessors and successors. To be held and
possessed in pure and perpetual gift without any duty or exaction
pertaining to me or my heirs, the monks themselves performing
the service which the <i>vill</i> owes to the lord King.” The monks
of Stanlawe retained possession until 1296, when their monastic
institution, with all its property, including Staining, was united to,
or appropriated by, the abbey of Whalley, shortly after which, in
1298, an agreement was arrived at between the prior of Lancaster,
who held Poulton church, and the abbot of Whalley, concerning
the tithes of Staining, Hardhorn, and Newton. “At length,” says
the record, “by the advice of common friends they submitted the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span>
matter to the arbitration of Robert de Pikeringe, Elbor. Official,”
who decided that the abbot and convent of Whalley, formerly of
Stanlawe, should receive in perpetuity the major tithes of every
and all their lands within the boundaries of Staining, Hardhorn,
and Newton, whether the harvests were cultivated by the monks
themselves or by their tenants; but the minor tithes, personal
and obligatory, whether of the abbey tenants or of the secular
servants, were adjudged to the vicar of the church of Poulton and
the prior and monks of Lancaster. The abbot of Whalley was
also directed to pay to the prior of Lancaster at the parish
church of Poulton an annual sum of eighteen marks, as an
acknowledgment, half at the festival of St. Martin and the
remainder at Pentecost. The Coucher Book contains several
deeds of arrangement touching marsh-land in the vicinity of
Staining. Cecilia de Laton, widow, gave to the abbot and convent
of Stanlawe, all her marsh between certain land of Staining and a
long ditch, so that the latter might mark the division between
Staining and Little Layton, the witnesses to the transfer being
William de Carleton, William de Syngleton, and Alan, his son,
William de Merton, and Richard de Thornton; Cecilia de Laton
also quitclaimed to the same monastery all her right to the
mediety of a marsh between “Mattainsmure” and Little Carleton.
William le Boteler exchanged with the Stanlawe brotherhood all
the marsh between the ditch above mentioned and the land of
Staining for a similar tract beyond the trench towards Great
Layton, stipulating that if at any time a fishery should be
established in the ditch, which was doubtless both wide and deep,
the monks and he, or his heirs, should participate equally in the
benefits accruing from it. Theobald Walter granted power to the
abbot of Stanlawe to make use of his mere of Marton for the
purpose of conducting therefrom a stream to turn the mill at
Staining, belonging to the monastery, care being taken that the
fish in the said mere were not injured or diminished. Within the
grange of Staining a chantry was in existence, and its services
were presided over by two resident priests, whose duty it also was
to superintend the property held by the convent of Stanlawe, and
subsequently by the abbey of Whalley, in the neighbourhood.</p>

messuage, 10 acres, held by Edmund Holle, 10s. 0d. In Carleton
the abbey owned a close named Whitbent, which William Carleton
rented at 1s. 6d., a year; and in Elswick, a barn and 3 acres of
land, held by Christopher Hennett, for an annual payment of 3s.
4d. In the Coucher Book of Whalley Abbey, from which the
foregoing information has been obtained there occurs the following
notice, relating to the Hall, apparently written when the above
survey was made:—“The house of Stayning is in length xxvii.
yards, and lofted ou’r and slated; ye close called ye little hey
contains by estimation halfe an acre, and ye said house payeth
yearly, 6s.” Sir Thomas Holt, of Grizlehurst, appears to have
been the first proprietor of the conventual lands of Staining after
they had been confiscated to the crown at the dissolution of
monasteries; and from him they were purchased, either towards
the end of the reign of Henry VIII., or at the commencement of
that of Edward VI., by George the son of Robert Singleton, by
his wife Helen, daughter of John Westby, of Mowbreck. The
Singletons, of Staining, resided at the Hall until the close of the
seventeenth century, and during that long period formed alliances
with several of the local families of gentry, as the Carletons of
Carleton, the Fleetwoods of Rossall, the Bambers of Carleton,
and the Masseys of Layton. On the death of George Singleton,
the last of the male representatives of the Singletons of Staining,
somewhere about 1790, the estates descended to John Mayfield,
the son of his sister Mary, and subsequently, on his decease
without issue, to his nephew and heir-at-law, William Blackburne.
Staining Hall, now the property of W. H. Hornby,
esq., of Blackburn, is a small and comparatively modern residence,
presenting in itself nothing calling for special notice or comment
from an antiquarian point of view. Remains of the old moat,
however, are still in existence round the building, but beyond this
there is no indication of the important station the Hall must have
formerly held in the surrounding country, both as the abode of
some of its priestly proprietors, of Stanlawe and Whalley, and the
seat of a family of wealth and position, like the Singletons would
seem to have been.</p>

<p>The township of Hardhorn-with-Newton contains the free
school erected and endowed by Mr. James Baines, which has
already been fully noticed in the chapter devoted to Poulton.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
In the hamlet of Staining a chapel and school combined was
erected by private munificence in 1865, the former building used
for such purposes being both inadequate and inappropriate. The
foundation stone was laid by Mrs. Clark, the wife of the late
vicar of Poulton, on a site given by W. H. Hornby, esq., of
Blackburn and Staining. The ceremony took place on the 26th
of May, 1865, and on the 3rd of December in that year service
was first performed in the edifice by the Rev. Richard Tonge, of
Manchester. The building is of brick, with stone dressings, and
comprises a nave, apsis, and tower of considerable altitude, containing
a fine toned bell.</p>

<p>On the 1st of February, 1748, Thomas Riding re-leased to John
Hornby and Thomas Whiteside, a dwelling-house and certain
premises for the remainder of a term of 1,000 years, to be held in
trust by them and their heirs for the use and benefit of the poor
housekeepers in Hardhorn-with-Newton township, in such
manner as directed by the will of Ellen Whitehead. The
property of this charity in 1817 consisted of half an acre of
ground, and three cottages and a weaving shed standing upon
it, together with £40 in money, out at interest. It cannot be
ascertained either who Ellen Whitehead was or when she died.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Biscopham was the appellation bestowed on the
district now called Bispham at and before the era of
William the Conqueror, in whose survey it appears
as embracing within its boundaries eight carucates of
arable land. The original name is simply a compound of the two
Anglo-Saxon words <i>Biscop</i>, a bishop, and <i>Ham</i>, a habitation or
settlement, the signification of the whole being obviously the
‘Bishop’s town,’ or ‘residence.’ Hence it is clear that some
episcopal source must be looked to as having been the means of
conferring the peculiar title on the place, and fortunately for the
investigator, the annals of history furnish a ready clue to what
otherwise might have proved a question difficult, or perhaps
impossible, of satisfactory solution. In a previous chapter it has
been noted that for long after the reign of Athelstan Amounderness
was held by the See of York, and nothing can be more natural
than to suppose, when regarding that circumstance in conjunction
with the significance of the name under discussion, that the
archbishops of the diocese had some residence on the soil of
Bispham. It is quite possible, however, that there may have been
merely a station of ecclesiastics who collected the rents and
tithes of the Hundred on behalf of the bishopric, acting in fact as
stewards and representatives of the archbishop for the time being,
but in either case it is evident that the name and, consequently,
the town, are of diocesan origin, doubtless associated with the
proprietorship above mentioned. The presence of priests in
residence within the manor of Bispham would necessarily lead to
the establishment there of some chapel or oratory, and the absence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span>
of any allusion to such a structure by the investigators of William
I. seems, at the first glance, a serious obstacle to the episcopal
theory, but Bispham was located between the two Danish colonies
of Norbreck and Warbreck, a people whose hostility to all religious
houses was almost proverbial, and hence it is scarcely likely that
a church so conveniently situated, as that of Bispham would be,
could long escape spoliation and destruction after the prelates of
York had removed their protection from the neighbourhood, at
some date anterior to the arrival of the Normans in England.
The ravages of the Danes indeed, throughout the Hundred of
Amounderness are usually the reasons assigned why the district
was relinquished by the See of York, so that the non-existence of
a sacred pile of any description at the period of the Domesday
Survey, is in no way contradictory of such a building having been
there, at an earlier epoch. At the close of the Saxon dynasty the
number of acres in cultivation in the manor of Bispham exceeded
those of the five next largest manors in the Fylde by two hundred,
thus Staining, Layton, Singleton, Marton, and Thornton, each
contained six hundred acres of arable soil, whilst Bispham had
eight hundred in a similar condition. About thirty years after
the Norman Survey, Geoffrey, the sheriff, bestowed the tithes of
Biscopham, upon the newly founded priory of St. Mary, in
Lancaster, being incited thereto by the munificent example of
Roger de Poictou. In this grant no allusion is made to any
church, an omission which we should barely be justified in
considering accidental, but which would rather seem to indicate
that the edifice was not erected until later. The earliest allusion
to it is found in the reign of Richard I., 1189—1199, when
Theobald Walter quitclaimed to the abbot of Sees, in Normandy,
all his right in the advowson of Pulton and the church of
Biscopham, pledging himself to pay to the abbey ten marks a year
during the period that any minister presented by him or his heirs
held the living.<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> In 1246 the mediety of Pulton and Biscopham
churches was conveyed to the priory of St. Mary, in Lancaster, an
offshoot from the abbey of Sees, by the archdeacon of Richmond;
and in 1296 the grant was confirmed to the monastery by John
Romanus, then archdeacon of Richmond, who supplemented the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span>
donation of his predecessor with a gift of the other mediety, to be
appropriated after the decease of the person in possession,
stipulating only that when the proprietorship became complete
the conventual superiors should appoint a vicar at an annual
salary of twenty marks. At the suppression of alien priories the
church of Bispham was conveyed to the abbey of Syon, and
remained attached to that foundation until the Reformation of
Henry VIII.</p>

<p>The original church of Bispham, subsequently to the Norman
invasion, was built of red sandstone, and comprised a low tower, a
nave, and one aisle. A row of semicircular arches, resting on
round, unornamented pillars, supported the double-gabled roof,
which was raised to no great altitude from the ground; whilst
the walls were penetrated by narrow lancet windows, three of
which were placed at the east end. The pews were substantial
benches of black oak. In 1773 this venerable structure was
deprived of its flag roof and a slate one substituted, the walls at
the same time being raised to their present height. During the
alterations the pillars were removed and the interior thoroughly
renovated, more modern windows being inserted a little later.
There is a traditional statement that the church was erected by
the monks of Furness, but beyond the sandstone of which it was
built having in all probability come from that locality, there
appears to be nothing to uphold such an idea. Over the main
entrance may still be seen an unmistakable specimen of the
Norman arch, until recent years covered with plaster, and in
that way retained in a very fair state of preservation.</p>

<p>In 1553 a commission, whose object was to investigate
“whether ye belles belongynge to certayne chapelles which be
specified in a certayne shedule be now remayning at ye said
chapelles, or in whose hands or custodie the same belles now be,”
visited Bispham, and issued the following report:—“William
Thompson and Robert Anyan, of ye chapell of Byspham, sworne
and examyned, deposen that one belle mentioned in ye said
shedule was solde by Edwarde Parker, named in ye former
commission, unto James Massie, gent., for ye some of <span class="allsmcap">XXIII</span>ˢ. <span class="allsmcap">IV</span>ᵈ.”
Nothing is known respecting the number or ultimate destination
of the peal alluded to. The belfry can now only boast a pair
of bells.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span></p>

<p>Formerly there were many and various opinions as to the
dedication of the church, Holy Trinity and All Saints having
both been suggested, but the question is finally set at rest by a
part, in fact the sole remnant, of the ancient communion service,
the chalice, which is of silver gilt, and bears the inscription:—“The
gift of Ann, Daughter to John Bamber, to ye Church of
Allhallows, in Bispham; Delivered by John Corritt, 1704.”
Within the building, fastened to the east wall, and immediately to
the right of the pulpit, are four monumental brasses inscribed as
under:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Here lyes the body of John Veale, late of Whinney Heys, Esq., who dyed the
20th Jan., 1704, aged sixty.”</p>

<p>“Here lyes the body of Susannah, wife of the late John Veale, Esq., of
Whinney Heys, Esq., who departed this life the 20th of May, 1718, aged 67
years.”</p>

<p>“Here lyes the body of Edward Veale, late of Whinney Heys, Esq., who
departed this life the 11th of August, 1723, aged 43 years.”</p>

<p>“Here lyes the body of Dorothy Veale, eldest daughter of John Veale, late of
Whinney Heys, Esq., who departed this life the 9th day of January, in the year of
our Lord, 1747, and in the 77th year of her age.”</p>

</div>

<p>Beneath these tablets, the only ones in the church, was the
family vault of the Veales, of Whinney Heys, now covered over
by pews. During the year 1875 the nave was re-seated, and at the
time when the flooring was taken up numerous skulls and bones
were found in different parts of the building, barely covered with
earth, plainly indicating that interments had once been very
frequent within the walls, and causing us to wonder that no mural
or other monuments, beyond those just given, are now visible, or,
indeed, remembered by any of the old parishioners. None of the
stones in the graveyard are of great antiquity, and the most
interesting object on that score is a portion of an ancient stone
cross, having the letters I.H.S. carved upon it, on the broken summit
of which a sun-dial has been mounted. Tradition has long affirmed
that Beatrice, or Bridget, the daughter of Oliver Cromwell, who
espoused General Ireton, and after his death General Fleetwood,
lies buried here, but this is a mistake, probably arising from the
proximity of the Rossall family, having the same name as her second
husband; the lady was interred at Stoke Newington on the 5th
of September, 1681. There are no stained glass windows, and the
walls of the church are whitewashed externally.</p>

<p>The living was a perpetual curacy until lately, when it was
raised to the rank of a vicarage. The Rev. Charles Hesketh,
M.A., of North Meols, has been the patron for almost half a
century. Divine worship, according to the ritual of the Roman
Catholics, was last celebrated in Bispham church during
March, 1559, immediately after the death of Queen Mary, when
her protestant successor, Elizabeth, ascended the throne. The
pastor, Jerome Allen, a member of the Benedictine brotherhood,
assembled his flock at nine in the morning of the 25th of that
month, and previous to administering the holy sacrament,
addressed a few words of farewell and advice to his congregation.
“Suffused in tears,” records the diary of Rishton, “this holy and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
good man admonished his people to obey the new queen, who
had succeeded Mary, the late one, and besought them to love God
above all things, and their neighbours as themselves.” It is said
that after vacating his cure at Bispham, the Rev. Jerome Allen,
retired to Lambspring, in Germany, where he spent the remainder
of his life in the strictest religious observances enjoined by his
creed. In 1650 the following remarks concerning Bispham
were recorded by the ecclesiastical commissioners of the Commonwealth:—“Bispham
hath formerly been a parish church,
containing two townships, Bispham-cum-Norbreck and Layton-cum-Warbreck,
and consisting of three hundred families; the
inhabitants of the said towns desire that they may be made a
parish.” In the survey of the Right Rev. Francis Gastrell, D.D.,
bishop of Chester, the annexed notice occurs:—“Bispham. Certif.
£8 0s. 0d., viz., a parcell of ground, given by Mr. R. Fleetwood,
worth, taxes deducted, £5 per year; Easter Reckonings, £3.
Richard Fleetwood, esq., of Rossall Hall, settled upon the church
in 1687 a Rent Charge of £10 per ann. for ever. Bispham-cum-Norbreck,
and Layton-cum Warbreck, for which places serve four
Churchwardens, two chosen by the ministers and two by the
parish.” In 1725 Edward Veale, of Whinney Heys, gave £200
to augment the living, and a similar amount was granted from
Queen Anne’s Bounty for a like purpose. Three years later £400
more were acquired, half from the fund just named, and half
from Mr. S. Walter. The parish registers commence in 1599.</p>

<p>William le Botiler, or Butler, held the manors of Layton,
Bispham, and Warbreck, according to the Duchy Feordary, in
the early part of the fourteenth century, and in 1365 his son, Sir
John Botiler, granted the manors of Great and Little Layton and
Bispham, to Henry de Bispham and Richard de Carleton, chaplains.
Great Bispham probably remained in the possession of the
church until the dissolution of the monasteries. Norbreck and
Little Bispham appear to have belonged to the convent of Salop,
and were leased by William, abbot of that house, together with
certain tithes in Layton, to the abbot and convent of Deulacres,
by an undated deed, for eight marks per annum, due at Martinmas.<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>
In 1539 the brotherhood of Deulacres paid rent for lands<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span>
in Little Bispham and Norbreck, and an additional sum of 2s.
to Sir Thomas Butler, for lands in Great Bispham.<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> After the
Reformation, Bispham was granted by Edward VI., in the sixth
year of his reign, to Sir Ralph Bagnell, by whom it was sold to
John Fleetwood, of Rossall; and in 1571, Thomas Fleetwood,
the descendant of the last-named gentleman, held Great and Little
Bispham and Layton.<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> The manors remained invested in the
Rossall family until the lifetime of the late Sir P. H. Fleetwood,
by whom they were sold to the Cliftons, of Lytham, John Talbot
Clifton, esq., of Lytham Hall, being the present lord.</p>

<p>The subjoined account of a shipwreck on this coast is taken
from the journal of William Stout, of Lancaster, and illustrates
the uses to which the church was occasionally put in similar
cases of emergency:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Our ship, Employment, met with a French ship of some force, bound to
Newfoundland, who made a prize of her. The French were determined to send
her directly to St. Malo; when John Gardner, the master, treated to ransome her,
and agreed with the captors for £1,000 sterling. The French did strip the sailors
of most of their clothes and provisions; and coming out of a hot climate to cold,
before they got home they were so weak that they were scarce able to work the
ship, and the mate being not an experienced pilot, spent time in making the land,
and was embayed on the coast of Wales, but with difficulty got off, and then made
the Isle of Man, and stood for Peel Fouldrey, but missed his course, so that he
made Rossall Mill for Walna Mill, and run in that mistake till he was embayed
under the Red Banks, behind Rossall, so as he could not get off; and it blowing
hard, and fearing she would beat, they endeavoured to launch their boat; but
were so weak that they could not do it, but came to an anchor. She struck off
her rudder, and at the high water mark she slipped her cables and run on shore,
in a very foul strong place, where she beat till she was full of water, but the men
got well to land. But it was believed if they had been able to launch the boat
and attempted to land in her, the sea was so high and the shore so foul, that they
might have all perished. This happened on the 8th month, 1702, and we had
early notice of it to Lancaster, and got horses and carts with empty casks to put
the damaged sugars in, and to get on shore what could be saved, which was done
with much expedition. We got the sugar into Esquire Fleetwood’s barn, at
Rossall, and the cotton wool into Bispham chapel, and in the neap tides got the
carpenters at work, but a storm came with the rising tides and beat the ship to
pieces. The cotton wool was sent to Manchester and sold for £200.”</p>

</div>

<p>In the early years of this century Bispham contained a
manufactory for the production of linsey-woolsey. The building
was three stories in height, and employed a considerable number<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>
of hands. Subsequently it was converted into a ladies’ school, and
afterwards pulled down. Two or three residences in the township
near the site of the old manufactory still retain the names of
‘factory houses,’ from their association with it. There is a small
Nonconformist place of worship in the village, surrounded by a
wall, being partially covered with ivy and overshadowed by trees.
This edifice is called Bethel Chapel, and a date over the doorway
fixes its origin at 1834. In 1868 a Temperance Hall, comprising
a reading room, library, and spacious lecture and assembly room,
was erected here by subscription, and forms one of the most
striking objects in the village. The Sunday school connected
with the parish church, and situated by its side, was erected also
by subscription, in 1840, and rebuilt on a larger scale in 1873.</p>

<p>The hamlet of Norbreck is situated on the edge of the cliffs
overhanging the shore of the Irish Sea, and consists of several
elegant residences tenanted by Messrs. Swain, Burton, Harrison,
Wilson, and Richards. None of the houses present any features
calling for special comment, but appear, like others at no great
distance, as Bispham Lodge, the seat of Frederick Kemp, esq., J.P.,
to have been built within comparatively recent years as marine
retreats for the gentry of neighbouring towns, or others more
intimately associated with the locality.</p>

<p>The area of the township includes 2,624 statute acres.</p>

<p>The Free Grammar School was established in 1659, when
Richard Higginson, of St. Faith’s, London, bequeathed unto the
parish of Bispham sundry annual gifts in perpetuity, and
especially the yearly payment of £30 for and towards the
support of a school-master and usher at the school of Bispham,
lately erected by him. From a subsequent deed it appears that
the annual sums were made chargeable on two messuages in
Paternoster Row, London, belonging to the dean and chapter of
St. Pauls, but as the interest Higginson possessed in such
property was acquired at the sale of the dean and chapter lands
during the Commonwealth, it followed that on the restoration
of Charles II., the rentals forming his bequest were not forthcoming.
Further, the document recites that John Amburst,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span>
of Gray’s-inn, esq., and Elizabeth, his wife, who was the widow
and sole executrix of Richard Higginson, being desirous that
the object of the founder should be carried out, paid to John
Bonny and others in trust £200, to be invested in land and the
annual income thereof devoted to the maintenance of an able and
learned schoolmaster at the before-mentioned school of Bispham.
The costs of a chancery suit in 1686 reduced the donation to £180,
but the trustees made up the sum to the original amount and
reimbursed themselves by deducting £5 per annum from the salary
of the master for four years. In 1687, Henry Warbreck conveyed
in consideration of £200, to James Bailey and five other trustees
of the charity, elected by a majority of the inhabitants, the closes
known as the Two Tormer Carrs, the Two New Heys, the Great
Hey, the Pasture, the Boon Low Side, the Little Field, and 35
falls of ground on the west of the Meadow Shoot close, amounting
to about 14 acres, and situated in Layton, “for the above-named
pious use; and it was agreed, that when any three of the five
trustees, or six of any eight which should hereafter be chosen,
should happen to die, the survivors should convey the premises to
eight new trustees to be chosen, two out of each of the respective
townships of Layton, Warbreck, Bispham, and Norbreck, by the
consent of the major part of the inhabitants of those townships,
and that the said trustees should from time to time employ the
rents for and towards the maintenance and benefit of an able and
learned schoolmaster, to teach at the school at Bispham.”<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> In
1817, Thomas Elston, and George Hodgson, of Layton, Robert
Bonny, and William Bonny, of Warbreck, William Butcher,
junior, and James Tinkler, of Bispham, and Thomas Wilson, and
Joseph Hornby, of Norbreck, were appointed trustees at a public
meeting convened by William Bamber and William Butcher, the
two surviving trustees. The newly elected governors were directed
“to permit the dwelling-house and school to be used as a residence
for the schoolmaster and a public school for the instruction of the
children of the parish of Bispham-with-Norbreck, in reading,
writing, arithmetic, English grammar, and the principles of the
English religion, gratuitously, as had been heretofore done, and to
hold the residue of the premises upon the trust mentioned in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span>
last deed.”<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> The commissioner who visited the school in 1868
remarked:—“The building is an old house, through whose
thatched roof the rain penetrates in winter, dropping all over the
desks, and gathering in pools upon the floor; the room is very
small, 30½ by 14½ feet and 7½ feet high to the spring of the roof,
and the air being so foul that I was obliged to keep the door open
while examining the children.” The use of the dilapidated
structure here alluded to has been discontinued, and the scholars
assemble in a room in the Temperance Hall until a fresh school-house
has been erected.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Layton-with-Warbreck</span> is the second of the two townships
comprised in the ancient parish of Biscopham or Bispham.
The Butlers, barons of Warrington, were the earliest lords of
Layton. In 1251, Robert Botiler, or Butler, obtained a charter
for a market and fair to be held in “his manor of Latton.” The
estate descended in the same family with some interruptions, until
the reign of Henry VIII., when it was sold by Sir Thomas Butler
to John Brown, of London, who on his part disposed of it, in 1553,
to Thomas Fleetwood. The manor was retained by the Fleetwoods
up to the time of the late Sir. P. Hesketh Fleetwood, of Rossall,
by whom it was conveyed, through purchase, to the Cliftons, of
Lytham. The following abstract from the title deed touching the
transfer of the property from John Brown to Thomas Fleetwood
will not be without interest to the reader:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“By Letters Patent under the Great Seal of England, bearing date the 19th day
of March, in the first year of the reign of Queen Mary. After reciting that Sir
Thomas Butler, Knight, was seized in fee of the Mannour of Layton, otherwise
Great Layton, with the Appurtenances, in the county of Lancaster, and that his
estate, title, and interest therein by due course of Law, came to King Henry the
Eighth, who entered thereon and was seized in fee thereof, and being so seized
did by his letters patents under the seal of his Duchy at Lancaster, bearing date
the 5th day of April, in the thirty-fourth year of his Reign, (amongst other things)
give, grant, and restore unto the said Sir Thomas Butler, his heirs, and Assigns, the
said Mannour and its Appurtenances, by virtue whereof the said Sir Thomas
Butler entered and was seized in fee thereof, and granted the same to John Brown,
Citizen and Mercer of London, his heirs and assigns, and that Brown entered and
was seized thereof in fee, and granted and sold the same to Thomas Fleetwood,
Esq., his heirs and Assigns, and that the said Thomas Fleetwood entered thereon
and was at that time seized in fee thereof. And further reciting that the said Sir
Thomas Butler held and enjoyed the said Mannour, with its Appurtenances, from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span>
the time of making said Grant until he sold and conveyed the same to the said
Brown without disturbance, and that the said Brown held the same until he sold
and conveyed to the said Thomas Fleetwood without disturbance, and that the said
Thomas Fleetwood had held and enjoyed the same for near four years without
disturbance, and was then seized in fee thereof. But because it had been doubted
whether the said Letters Patent and Grant made by King Henry the Eighth to
Sir Thomas Butler were good and valid in the Law, because they were under the
Seal of the Duchy of Lancaster, and not under the Great Seal, and because it
appeared unto her said Majesty, that the said King Henry the Eighth, her Father,
had promised that the said Sir Thomas Butler, should have the said Grant either
under the Great Seal or the seal of the Duchy of Lancaster, She willing to perform
her Father’s promise and to remove all doubts, and for greater security of the said
Mannour, unto the said Thomas Fleetwood and his heirs, and in consideration of
the faithful services done by the said Thomas Fleetwood to her said Father, and
to her Brother King Edward the Sixth, and to her, did give, grant, and confirm
unto the said Thomas Fleetwood, his heirs and assigns, the Mannour of Layton,
otherwise Great Layton, with its rights, members, and Appurtenances, in the said
county of Lancaster, and all and singular the Messuages, Houses, Buildings, Tofts,
Cottages, Lands, Tenements, Meadows, Feedings, Pastures, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c., Fishing,
Wrecks of the Sea, Woods, Underwoods, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c., commodities, emoluments and
Hereditaments whatsoever, with their Appurtenances, situate, lying, and being in
the Vill, Fields, or Hamlets of Layton, otherwise Great Layton, aforesaid, which
were of the said Thomas Butler, and which the said John Brown afterwards sold
to the said Thomas Fleetwood as aforesaid, To hold the same unto the said
Thomas Fleetwood his heirs and assigns for ever.”</p>

</div>

<p>Reverting to the market and fair above-mentioned we find that
in 1292 Sir William le Botiler was called upon to show upon what
right he laid claim to free warren in Layton, and two other places.
In proving his case, the knight stated that his privileges extended
to markets, fairs, and assize of bread and beer, in addition to which
he affirmed that wreck of the sea had been the hereditary rights of
his ancestors from the accession of William the Conqueror. The
jury acknowledged the title of Sir William in each instance,
ordaining that the same markets, fairs, etc., should continue to be
held or exercised as aforetime. It would appear that the market
took place each week on Wednesday, the chief merchandise offered
for sale being most likely cattle and smallware. There are now
no remnants of the market, which must at one era have been an
assembly of no mean importance, beyond the names of the market-house
and the market-field. The cross and stocks have also
succumbed to the lapse of years, the latter being a matter of
tradition only, with all, even to the oldest inhabitant.</p>

<p>In 1767 a petition was presented to the House of Parliament,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[308]</span>
setting forth that within the manor of Layton and parishes of
Poulton and Bispham there was situated an extensive tract of land
containing about 2,000 acres, called Layton Hawes, and begging
on the part of those concerned, for permission to enclose the whole
of the common. The document states “that Fleetwood Hesketh,
Esquire, is Lord of the Manor of Layton aforesaid; and Edmund
Starkie, Esquire, is Impropriator of the Great Tythes arising within
that part of the Township of Marton called Great Marton, within
the said Manor of Layton and Parish of Poulton, and of One
Moiety of the Great Tythes arising in that part of the Township
of Bispham called Great Bispham, within the said Manor and
Parish of Bispham; and Thomas Cross, Esquire, and others, his
partners, are proprietors of the other Moiety of the Great Tythes
arising within Great Bispham aforesaid; and Ashton Werden,
Clerk, present Incumbent of the Parish Church of Bispham aforesaid,
and his Successors for the time being, of the Great Tythes,
arising within the Township of Layton-with-Warbreck, within the
said Manor and Parish of Bispham. Also that the said Fleetwood
Hesketh, Thomas Clifton, and other Owners and Proprietors of
divers ancient Farms, situate within the Manor of Layton, and the
towns of Great Marton, Little Marton, Black Pool, and Bispham,
have an exclusive Right to turn and depasture their Beasts, Sheep,
and other Commovable Cattle, in and upon the said Waste or
Common, called Layton Hawes, at all Times of the Year; and the
Parties interested are willing and desirous that the said Waste or
Common should be inclosed, allotted and divided, and therefore pray
that the said Waste or Common called Layton Hawes, lying
within the Manor of Layton, may be divided, set out, and allotted
by Commissioners, to be appointed for that purpose and their
Successors, in such manner, and subject to such rules, orders,
regulations, and directions, as may be thought necessary.” Leave
to carry out the object contained in the prayer was granted to the
petitioners, and within a comparatively short time the work of
dividing and apportioning the soil accomplished.</p>

<p>The greater part of the township of Layton-with-Warbreck
being now absorbed in the borough of Blackpool, to which the
ensuing chapter will be devoted, there is little further to notice
beyond the ancient seats of the families of Rigby and Veale.
Layton Hall was probably the residence of the Butlers, of Layton,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[309]</span>
previous to the opening of the seventeenth century, when it was
sold to Edward Rigby, of Burgh; at least that gentleman was the
first of the Rigbys whose <i>Inq. post mortem</i> disclosed that he held
possessions in Layton. The Hall remained in the ownership and
tenancy of the Rigbys until the lifetime of Sir Alexander Rigby,
who married Alice, the daughter of Thomas Clifton, of Lytham,
and died about 1700.<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> The original edifice, which was taken down
and a farm-house erected on the site about one century ago, was a
massive gabled building. At the bottom of the main staircase
was a gate, or grating, of iron, the whole of the interior of the
Hall being fitted with oak panels, etc., in a very antique style.</p>

<p>Whinney Heys was held by the Veales from the time of Francis
Veale, living in 1570, until the death of John Veale, about two
hundred years later, when it passed to Edward Fleetwood, of
Rossall Hall, who had married the sister and heiress of John
Veale.<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> The Hall of Whinney Heys was embosomed in trees and
presented nothing of special moment to the eye, being simply a
large rough-cast country building of an early type. It was
partially taken down many years since and converted to farming
uses.</p>

<p>“The village affords,” says Mr. Thornber,<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> “an example of
covetousness seldom equalled. John Bailey, better known by
the name of the Layton miser, resided in a cottage near the
market-house. His habits were most frugal, enduring hunger
and privation to hoard up his beloved pelf. Once, during every
summer, his store was exposed to the beams of the sun, to undergo
purification, and he might be seen, on that occasion, with a loaded
gun, seated in the midst of his treasure, guarding it with the eyes
of Argus, from the passing intruder. Notwithstanding all this
vigilance, upwards of £700 was stolen from his hoard; and this
ignorant old man journeyed to some distance to consult the wise
man in order to regain it; his manœuvre to avoid the income-tax
also failed, for although he converted his landed property into
guineas, concealing them in his house, and then pleaded that he
possessed no <i>income</i>, but a <i>capital</i> only, the law compelled him to
pay his due proportion. In the midst of his savings, death smote<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span>
this wretched being, and even then his ruling passion was strong
in the very agony of departing nature. His gold watch, the only
portion of his property which remained unbequeathed, hung
within his reach; his greedy eye was riveted upon it; no he could
not part with that dear treasure—and, with an expiring effort, he
snatched it from the head of his bed, and it remained clenched in
his hand and convulsed fingers long after warmth had forsaken his
frame. Alas! His hidden store, all in gold, weighing 65lb, was
discovered at the close of a tedious search, in a walled up window,
to which the miser had had access from without, and was carried
home in a malt sack, a purse not often used for such a purpose.”</p>

<p class="dropcap">Blackpool is situated in the township of Layton-with-Warbreck,
and occupies a station on the west
coast, about midway between the estuaries of the
rivers Ribble and Wyre. The watering-place of
to-day with its noble promenade, elegant piers, handsome hotels,
and princely terraces, forms a wonderful and pleasing contrast to
the meagre group of thatched cabins which once reared their
lowly heads near the peaty pool, whose dark waters gave rise
to the name of the town. This pool, which was located at the
south end of Blackpool, is stated to have been half a mile in
breadth, and was due to the accumulation of black, or more
correctly speaking, chocolate-coloured waters,<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> from Marton Mere
and the turf fields composing the swampy region usually designated
the “Moss.” It remained until the supplies were cut off by
diverting their currents towards other and more convenient
outlets, when its contents gradually decreased, finally leaving no
trace of their former site beyond a small streamlet, which now
discharges itself with the flows of Spendike into the sea, opposite
the point where the Lytham Road branches from the promenade.
The principal portion of the town stands a little removed from the
edge of a long line of cliffs, whose altitude, trifling at first,
considerably increases as they travel northwards; and from that
broad range of frontage streets and houses in compact masses<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[312]</span>
run backwards towards the country, covering an annually
extending area.</p>

<p>One of the oldest and most interesting relics of antiquity is still
preserved in the Fox Hall Hotel, or Vaux Hall, as it is sometimes,
but we opine, for reasons stated hereafter, incorrectly written,
although its name, site, and long cobble wall are nearly the only
mementoes that time and change have failed to remove. It was
here in the reign of Charles II. that Edward, the son of the gallant
and loyal Sir Thomas Tyldesley who was slain at the battle of
Wigan-lane in 1651, having been led to expect a grant of the
lands of Layton Hawes, or Heys Side, from the king, after the
restoration, in return for his own and his father’s staunch adherence
to the royal cause, built a small sequestered residence as a summer
retreat for his family. Modest and unpretending as the dimensions
appear to have been, no doubt at that time it was regarded as a
stately mansion, and looked upon with becoming respect and
admiration by the inhabitants of the few clay-built and rush-roofed
huts which were scattered around it. The house itself was a
three gabled structure with a species of tower, affording an
extensive survey over the neighbouring country; there were four
or five rooms on each story, and one wing of the building was
fitted up and used as a chapel, the officiating priest being most
probably the Rev. W. Westby, the “W. W.” of the diary kept by
Thomas Tyldesley during the years he resided there. The chapel
portion of the old house was at a later period, when the remainder,
after experiencing various fortunes, had fallen into decay, converted
into a cottage. Over the chief entrance Edward had inscribed
the words—“Seris factura Nepotibus,” the motto of an order of
Knighthood, called the Royal Oak, which Charles II. contemplated
establishing when first he regained his throne, but afterwards for
certain reasons<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> altered his mind, as he also appears to have done
in regard to the Hawes property, for it never passed into the
possession of the Tyldesleys by royal favour, or in any other way.
A fox secured by a chain was allowed to ramble for a short distance
in front of the doorway, and whether the presence of that animal,
together with the use of the Hall as a hunting seat, as well as a
summer retreat, originated its name, or its first title was Vaux,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[313]</span>
and by an easy and simple process of change became altered to
Fox, the reader must decide for himself; but after he has perused
the following extract from the Tyldesley Diary, in which the
priest already mentioned is alluded to as “W. W.”, he will, we
venture to think, have little difficulty in concluding that the
cognomen Vaux is merely a modern adaptation when applied to
this Hall:—</p>

<p>Edward Tyldesley surrounded the Hall with a high and massive
wall of cobble stones, strongly cemented together, as a protection
very needful in those times of turmoil and persecution. A large
portion of the wall still exists in an almost perfect state of preservation,
notwithstanding the fierce gales and boisterous tides
that have, at intervals, battered against it for more than two
centuries. This, with the additional safeguards that nature had
provided by means of the broad sea to the front, a small stream
running over swampy, almost impassable, ground to the south,
and a pool<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> under its east side, rendered the house a secure
asylum for those who were constrained to practise</p>

<p class="noindent">and remove themselves for a season from the eyes of the world
and their enemies. Over the high gateway at the south end of the
enclosure he placed a stone carved with the crest of the Tyldesley
family—a pelican feeding its young—encircled by the loyal and
patriotic motto—“Tantum valet amor regis et patriæ”: for long
the roughly finished piece of carving was visible in the wall of an
outbuilding, from which, however, it has recently been removed.
Fox Hall was not without its plot of garden ground, a considerable
space, being devoted to the useful products, was known as the
kitchen garden, whilst another space was devoted to an apiary,
and flowers must be supposed to have been an accompanyment of
bees. It also boasted a bowling green and an ancient fig tree.</p>

<p>Thomas, the son of Edward Tyldesley, born in 1657, succeeded
to the family estates on the death of his father, and later married,
as his second wife, Mary, sister and co-heiress, with Elizabeth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>[314]</span>
Colley, of Sir Alexander Rigby, knt., of Layton Hall, High-sheriff
of the county of Lancashire in 1691, whose father had erected a
monument to the memory of Sir Thomas Tyldesley near the spot
where he was slain.</p>

<p>During the year 1690, when the dethroned monarch James
II. invaded Ireland in the hope of regaining his crown,
Thomas Tyldesley prepared a secret chamber for his reception
in the interior of the Hall. The closet or hiding-place was
afterwards known as the King’s Cupboard. The Pretender,
also, was reported to have been concealed for some time within
Fox Hall, and although it is certain that this aspirant to the
British throne was never within its friendly walls, still the secret
recesses, called “priests’ holes,” with which it appears to have
been liberally provided, formed excellent refuges for the clergy
and other members of the Romish Church, who on the slightest
alarm were enclosed therein, and so secluded from the prying eyes
of their hostile countrymen until the danger had passed. These
latter incidents did not take place until after the decease of
Thomas Tyldesley, who died in 1715, shortly before the outbreak
of the rebellion, and was buried at Churchtown, near Garstang.
His son Edward, who succeeded him, was arrested for taking part
with the rebels, and escaped conviction and punishment only by
the mercy or sympathy of the jury, who after returning their
verdict of acquittal were severely censured by the presiding judge
for their incompetency and disaffection. Edward Tyldesley died
in 1725.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> At what date Fox Hall passed out of the hands of the
Tyldesleys, it is impossible to trace, but it is doubtful whether the
Edward here named ever resided there, as he is always described
as of Myerscough Lodge, another seat of the family. Mary
Tyldesley, the widow of his father, whom it will be remembered
he married as his second wife, was living there as owner in 1720,
and from that circumstance we must infer that the Blackpool
house was bequeathed to her by her husband Thomas Tyldesley,
and that the other portion only of the estates fell to Edward, the
son of his first marriage and his heir. Poverty seems to have
overtaken the family with rapid strides; their different lands and
residences were either mortgaged or sold, and whether Fox Hall<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>[315]</span>
descended to the children of Mary Tyldesley, or returned again
into the more direct line, it is certain that not many years after
the death of Thomas Tyldesley it had ceased to be one of their
possessions.</p>

<p>Thus, the annals of the founders of this solitary mansion carry
us back to the period between 1660 and 1685, that is from the
restoration to the death of Charles II., but certain entries in the
register of Bispham church show that there must have been
dwellings and a population, however thinly scattered, on the soil
anterior to that period, sometime during the sixteenth century,
and it was doubtless the descendants of these people who inhabited
the neighbourhood when Edward Tyldesley appeared upon the
scene and erected Fox Hall. The primitive structures forming
the habitations of these aborigines were built of clay, roughly
plastered on to wattles, and thatched with rushes more frequently
than straw, the whole fabric being supported on crooks driven
into the ground. About the epoch of Thomas Tyldesley drainage
and cultivation began to render the aspect of the country more
inviting, and fresh families were tempted to come down to the
coast and rear their humble abodes under the wing of the great
mansion, so that after a while a small hamlet of clustering huts
was formed. It is more than probable that the morals and
conduct of the dwellers in these huts were influenced in some way
or other by the sojourners at the Hall, but whether for good or
evil we are unable to say, as the time is now so hopelessly remote
and no records of their habits and doings are extant, so that in
the absence of any proof to the contrary, it is only fair and
charitable to surmise that their lives were as simple as their
surroundings.</p>

<p>Whether the Tyldesleys were induced to locate themselves on
this spot solely by a prospect of possessing some of the territory
around, or were actuated also by a desire to have a retreat far
removed from the scenes of disturbance with which the different
factions were constantly vexing the land, is a matter of little
importance, but to their presence it was due that the natural
beauties of Blackpool were brought before the people at an early
date. There can be no doubt that the priests and others, who had
fled to the Hall as a harbour of refuge, would, on returning to
their own districts, circulate glowing and eulogistic accounts of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316"></a>[316]</span>
the place they had been visiting—of the glorious beauty of the
sea, the endless stretch of level sands, and the bracing purity of
the breeze. In such manner a desire would readily be implanted
in the bosoms of their auditory to become personally acquainted
with the new land, which had created such a deep and favourable
impression on the minds of men, whose positions and education
warranted the genuineness of their statements and enhanced the
value of their opinions. There is one other circumstance worthy
to be mentioned as having in all likelihood aided considerably in
bringing the place into notice, and that is an annual race meeting,
held for long on Layton Hawes. The proximity of the site to the
residences of so many families of wealth and distinction, as the
Allens of Rossall, the Westbys of Burn Hall, the Rigbys of Layton
Hall, the Veales of Whinney Heys, the Heskeths of Mains, the
Cliftons of Lytham, and the Tyldesleys of Blackpool, must have
rendered the assembly one of no mean importance, and we may
picture in our minds the gay and brilliant scene presented each
year on the outskirts of the present town, when our ancestors in
their antique and many-hued costumes congregated to witness the
contests of their favourite steeds, and the level turf echoed to the
fleet hoofs of the horses as the varied colours of their riders flashed
round the course.</p>

<p>Although these incidents must have greatly tended to give
publicity to Blackpool, its early advances towards popularity were
dilatory, but this is to be attributed rather to the unsettled state
of the times than to a tardy appreciation of its advantages by
those who had enjoyed them or heard them described. During
the reign of George I., 1714-1727, a mere sprinkling of visitors
seems to have been attracted each summer to the hamlet, but a
few years later, about 1735, they had become sufficiently numerous
to induce one Ethart à Whiteside to prepare a cottage specially
for their reception and entertainment. Common report whispers
that he was further prompted to the venture by being the
fortunate possessor of a wife whose skill in cookery far excelled
that of any of her neighbours, but be that as it may, whether he
espoused the Welsh maiden because her culinary accomplishments
were an additional recommendation to him in the sphere in which
he had embarked, or whether the lodging house was a cherished
dream only converted into a reality on their discovery after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[317]</span>
marriage, one thing is certain, his speculation prospered, and at
the end of fifty years he retired on what at that era was considered
a fortune. The house in which he had laboured for half a century
was situated in the fields now occupied by General Street and the
neighbouring houses, on the site of what not long ago was a ladies’
school; in appearance, it was a very ordinary cottage with the
usual straw thatch, somewhat oblong in form and possessing few
attractions to tempt the stranger to prolong his stay, but in spite
of all its disadvantages, the fascination of the sea and the novelty
of the surroundings filled it with guests summer after summer.
This dwelling claims the honour of having been the first ever fitted
up and arranged as a lodging house in Blackpool. On the retirement
of Whiteside, who a few years afterwards died at Layton, it passed
into the hands of a noted aboriginal, called Tom the Cobbler,
who appears to have held more ambitious views than his
predecessor, and converted the cottage into an inn, or at least
embellished its exterior with a rude lettered sign, and procured a
license to supply exciseable commodities within. Those who had
been accustomed to the scrupulous care and cleanliness of
Whiteside and his thrifty wife, must have experienced a considerable
shock from the eccentricities of the new proprietor; each day
at the dinner hour he entered in working costume amongst the
assembled guests, and with grimy fingers produced from the depths
of his well rosined apron the allotted portion of bread for each.
How this peculiarity was appreciated by his visitors there are no
means of ascertaining, but as his dwelling did not develope in the
course of years into a modern and commodious hotel like the
other licensed houses which sprang up about that time and a little
later, we are inclined to fear that some internal mismanagement
caused its collapse.</p>

<p>In 1769 the whole hamlet comprised no more than twenty-eight
houses, or more correctly speaking hovels, for, with the exception
of four that had been raised to the dignity of slate roofs and a small
inn on the site of the present Clifton Arms Hotel, they were little
if any better. These were scattered widely apart along the beach,
and one of them standing on the ground now occupied by the
Lane Ends Hotel, and adjoining a small blacksmith’s shed, was
a favourite resort of visitors in search of refreshment. Turf stacks
fronted almost every door, and the refuse of the household was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318"></a>[318]</span>
either carelessly thrown forth or else accumulated in putrifying
heaps by the sides of the huts, so that nothing but their isolated
situations and the constant currents of pure air from the sea
sweeping over and around them could possibly have prevented
the outbreak of some infectious and fatal disorder.</p>

<p>Bonny’s Hotel, then known as old Margery’s, and standing in
the fields to the south, some distance from the sea, sprang up a
little anterior to this time and received its share of patronage;
later it was converted into a boys’ school and during recent years
has been divided into cottages, etc. The Gynn House, erected
northwards near the extremity or apex of a deep and wide fissure
in the cliffs, formed another popular haunt during the season; the
landlord at that hostel created much amusement by his oddities,
and especially by his quaint method of casting up the reckoning
on a horse-block in front of the door and speeding the “parting
guest” with—“and Sir, remember the servants.” A true
and remarkable anecdote is related about the old inn;
sometime during the summer of 1833 a sudden and terrific
storm burst over the western coast of this island, many
vessels were lost and the shore off Blackpool was strewn with
the battered fragments of unfortunate ships, which had either
foundered in the deep or been dashed to pieces as they lay helplessly
stranded on the outlying sandbanks. In the night as the gale
raged with its utmost fury, a Scotch sloop was beating off the
coast, vainly endeavouring to battle with the hurricane, and
driven by the force of wind and wave nearer and nearer to the
precipitous cliffs. When all hope had been abandoned and
destruction seemed inevitable, some thoughtful person placed a
lighted candle in the window of the Gynn House; guided by this
faint glimmer, the vessel passed safely up the creek, and the
exhausted sailors were rescued from a dreadful death. Next
morning a sad and harrowing scene presented itself along the
coast; no less than eleven vessels were lying within a short
distance of each other, with their torn rigging and shattered spars
hanging from their sides; brigs, sloops, and schooners, the short
but fearful gale had left little of them beyond their damaged hulls.
Nor were these the only victims of the storm, for as the tide
receded to its lowest the masts of two others rose above the surface
of the water; and during the next few days three large ships<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319"></a>[319]</span>
drifted past the town in an apparently waterlogged condition.</p>

<p>About that date, 1769, several heaps of mortar and other
building materials, lying on the road which separated the front of
the village from the edge of the cliffs, showed that more were
anxious to follow in the footsteps of Whiteside and his earlier
imitators.</p>

<p>Some idea may be formed of the class of people who visited
Blackpool at that period from the charges made at Bonny’s Hotel
and the Gynn, the two principal inns, for board and lodging; at
the latter eightpence per day satisfied the modest demands of the
host, while at the former the sum of tenpence was exacted, with
a view no doubt of upholding its superior claims to respectability.
In drawing our conclusions from these facts we must bear in mind
that a shilling in those days represented much greater value than
it does at present, so that the charges may not have been really so
inadequate as they now appear. The village contained neither
shop nor store where the necessaries or luxuries of life, if such
things were ever dreamt of by the people, could be purchased, and
large quantities of provisions had to be laid in at one time.
Occasionally a sudden and unexpected influx of visitors occurred
inopportunely, when the larder was low, and as a consequence the
hungry guests were forced to wait, temporising with their
appetites as best they could, until a journey had been made to
Poulton and fresh supplies procured.</p>

<p>Ten years later the hamlet had grown somewhat in size, and
the annually increasing numbers who flocked to its shores showed
that its popularity was steadily gaining ground. Intercourse with
the world beyond their own limited circle seems, however, to have
had anything but an elevating or civilising effect upon the inhabitants,
for we find amongst them at that time a band of professed
atheists, whose blasphemous conduct called forth no rebuke or
opposition from the rest, but was quietly tolerated, if not indeed
approved. Each fortnight during the summer fairs were held on
the Sabbath to provide refreshment and amusement for the
visitors, who came in crowds to witness the magnificence of the
highest spring tides. These gatherings usually terminated in
disgraceful scenes of revelry and debauchery. Smuggling was
carried on between the coast opposite the Star-hills and the Isle
of Man, but never to a great extent or for any lengthened period.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320"></a>[320]</span>
These huge mounds of sand, much more numerous than in
our day, formed excellent store-houses for the contraband goods,
generally spirits, which were packed in hampers, and so overlaid
with fish that their presence was never even suspected. The
illicit cargoes were brought across the channel in trading vessels,
from which they were landed by means of light open boats, and
at once secreted in the manner just indicated, until a suitable
opportunity occurred for their removal to one of the neighbouring
towns. The success attending these ventures induced the
smugglers to construct a sloop of their own, with the intention of
prosecuting so profitable a trade on a larger scale, but information
of their proceedings having been conveyed by some one to official
quarters, a detachment of soldiers was promptly despatched to put
an end to the nefarious practices. So thoroughly did these men
effect their purpose, that, although no capture is recorded as
having taken place, the whole band was dispersed, and from that
date no more offences of this character have been known on the
coast.</p>

<p>In 1788 the houses of Blackpool had increased to about thirty-five,
and these were arranged in an irregular line along the edge
of the cliffs; the intervals between the habitations being with
few exceptions so wide that this small number stretched out from
north to south, over a distance of quite a mile. One group of six
was especially remarkable as presenting a more respectable and
modern exterior than any of the others, most of which still retained
a great deal of their original defective appearances, as though their
owners were unwilling or unable to adapt themselves and their
abodes to the improved state of things springing up around them.
The company during the busiest part of the season amounted to
about four hundred persons, and a news-room had been established
for their use in the small cottage, before mentioned, on the site of
the Lane Ends Hotel, the smith’s shop adjoining having been
converted into a coffee-room and kitchen, at which a public
dinner was prepared each day during the summer, and served at
a dining-room erected across the way. There were now four
additional inns in the village, named respectively, Bailey’s, Forshaw’s,
Hull’s, and the Yorkshire House. The first of these had
sprung up on the cliffs towards the north, and was kept by an
ancestor of its present proprietor; the second was the nucleus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321"></a>[321]</span>
from which has grown the Clifton Arms Hotel, whilst the third
stood on the site of the Royal Hotel. The roads leading to the
hamlet were in such an unfinished state that after heavy falls
of rain they could be travelled only with the greatest difficulty,
and often with considerable danger both to the vehicle and its
occupants; so that under these circumstances most people
deemed it more prudent and expedient to perform the journey on
horseback, some of them in the pillion fashion usual at that
era. In an earlier part of this chapter we spoke of the troubled
state of the times and the unsettled and harassed condition of the
people as being the most probable causes why Blackpool was so
long neglected by many who must have been well cognisant of its
beauties in the days of the Tyldesleys, and with equal probability
may we now conjecture that the dilapidated and frequently
unsafe state of the highways had a serious effect in preventing
numbers from visiting the place at this period. Regarding the
matter from another point of view, we are led to infer that the
four hundred composing the company of 1788, were people
who, either in search of health or recreation, had willingly undergone
the discomforts of a dreary and sometimes hazardous journey
in order to make but a brief sojourn by the shores of Blackpool.
Here, then, there is evidence of the great estimation in which the
place was held at that early date by the dwellers in the inland
towns, and of the rapidity with which its good fame was increasing
and extending throughout a large section of the county. As may
be naturally supposed, the large influxes of visitors and their
turn-outs during the height of the season very much overtaxed the
accommodation provided for them by the inhabitants, but that
difficulty was easily surmounted by turning the horses loose into
a field until their services were again required, whilst the surplus
health or pleasure-seekers were lodged in barns or any outbuildings
sufficiently protected from the weather. The village
possessed two bowling greens of diminutive size, one of which
occupied the land at the south-west corner of Lytham Street,
whilst the other was in connection with the Yorkshire House,
afterwards the York Hotel, and since purchased by a company of
gentlemen, who razed it to the ground in order to erect more
suitable buildings on the site. There was also a theatre, if that
will bear the name which during nine months of the year existed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322"></a>[322]</span>
under the more modest title of a barn; rows of benches were
placed one behind another, and separated into a front and back
division, designated respectively pit and gallery. This house is
said to have been capable of holding six pounds, the prices of
admission being one and two shillings. At that period bathing
vans were scarce, the majority of bathers making use of boxes,
which were placed for their convenience along the shore, and as
the mode in which they secured privacy and a proper separation
of the sexes during indulgence in this pastime was both ingenious
and entertaining, we will give a brief sketch of their arrangements.
At a certain hour each day, varying according to the
changes of the tide, a bell was rung when the water had risen
almost to its highest. On hearing the signal, the whole of the
gentlemen, however agreeably occupied, were compelled, under a
penalty of one bottle of wine for each offence, to vacate the shore
and betake themselves to their several hotels or apartments, whilst
the ladies, after sufficient time had elapsed for any stray member
of the sterner sex to get safely and securely housed, emerged
singly or in small groups from the different doorways, and, hurrying
down to the edge of the sea, quickly threw off their loose
bathing robes, and in a moment were sporting amid the waves
like a colony of nereids or mermaids. When these had finished
their revels and duly retired to their homes, the bell rang a second
time, and the males, released from <i>durance vile</i>, made their way
to the beach, and were not long in following the example of their
fair predecessors.</p>

<p>Mr. Hutton, in his small pamphlet descriptive of Blackpool in
1788, says:—“The tables here are well supplied; if I say too well
for the price I may please the innkeepers, but not their guests.
Shrimps are plentiful; five or six people make it their business to
catch them at low water, and produce several gallons a day, which
satisfy all but the catchers. They excel in cooking, nor is it
surprising, for forty pounds and her maintenance is given to a
cook for the season only. Though salt water is brought in plenty
to their very doors, yet this is not the case with fresh. The place
yields only one spring for family use; and the water is carried by
some half a mile, but is well worth carrying, for I thought it the
most pleasant I ever tasted.”</p>

<p>The prices at the inns and boarding-houses had risen as the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323"></a>[323]</span>
accommodation they offered had improved in quality and
increased in extent, so that it was no longer possible to subsist on
the daily expenditure of a few pence as in former times. In
hotels of the first class 3s. 4d. per day, exclusive of liquors, was
the charge for board and lodging; dinner and supper being
charged 1s. each to the casual visitor, and tea or breakfast 8d.
In those of the second-class and some of the lodging-houses,
2s. 6d. per day covered everything with the exception of tea,
coffee, sugar, and liquors; whilst the smaller lodging-houses,
generally crowded with visitors who were either willing or
compelled to content themselves with the more frugal fare
provided, charged only 1s. 6d. per day for each guest.</p>

<p>A promenade, six yards wide, carpeted with grass and separated
from the road by white wooden railings, ran along the verge of
the sea bank for a distance of two hundred yards, and was
ornamented at one end with an alcove, whilst the other terminated
abruptly at a rough clayey excavation, afterwards used as a brick
croft. “Here,” says the topographer already quoted, “is a full
display of beauty and of fashion. Here the eye faithful to its
trust, conveys intelligence from the heart of one sex to that of the
other; gentle tumults rise in the breast; intercourse opens in
tender language; the softer passions are called into action;
Hymen approaches, kindles his torch, and cements that union
which continues for life. Here may be seen folly flushed with
money, shoe-strings, and a phæton and four. Keen envy sparkles
in the eye at the display of a new bonnet. The heiress of eighteen
trimmed in black, and a hundred thousand pounds, plentifully
squanders her looks of disdain, or the stale <i>Belle</i>, who has outstood
her market, offers her fading charms upon easy terms.”</p>

<p>This parade was extended some years later by means of a bridge
thrown from its south extremity over the road leading down to
the shore, and on to the cliffs of the opposite side. Riding or
walking, for those who were not fortunate enough to possess a
horse or equipage, on the sands or promenade, and excursions into
the country as far as the “Number 3 Hotel,” where many of the
company amused themselves with drinking “fine ale,” were the
favourite pastimes during the day, varied, however, with an
occasional practice at the butts for bow and arrow shooting, the
diurnal bathe, and contests on the bowling greens, to which we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324"></a>[324]</span>
have already alluded; in the evening or during unfavourable
weather cards and backgammon, or the theatre, were the means
with which the visitors beguiled the wearisomeness of the quiet
hours. The “Number 3 Hotel” above-mentioned stood behind
the present building bearing that name, at the corner of the
Layton and Marton roads.</p>

<p>Mr. Hutton relates several somewhat startling instances of the
curative properties of the sea at Blackpool; amongst them that of
a man, by trade a shoemaker and a resident of Lancaster, who
having become, through some unexplained cause, totally blind,
visited this watering-place for six weeks, during which he drank
large quantities of the marine element, daily bathing his eyes in the
same, and at the end of that time had so far recovered his sight
that he could readily distinguish objects at a distance of two miles.
Another case was that of a gentleman, who, having been seized
with a paralytic attack, which deprived him of the use of one
side, was ordered by his physician to Bath, but finding, after a fair
trial, that he derived no benefit from the combined action of its
climate and waters, he determined to travel northwards and make
a short sojourn at Blackpool. Whilst there the invalid was daily
carried into and out of the sea, and even after this process had been
only twice repeated he had lost the violent pains in his joints,
recovered his sleep, and in some considerable degree the muscular
power of the affected side, but of his further progress there is
no account.</p>

<p>The following lines, written by a visitor a few years after the
incidents we have just narrated, also show in what great estimation
the climate and sea of the village were held as remedial and
invigorating agents:—</p>

<p>At this time Blackpool was not only without a church, but in
the whole place there was no room where the inhabitants or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325"></a>[325]</span>
visitors were accustomed to assemble together for divine worship,
and it was not until 1821 that the sacred edifice of St. John was
completed and opened. In 1789 a subscription was started for
the purpose of erecting a church, but was soon closed for want of
support, barely one hundred pounds having been promised.
Some years later a large room at one of the hotels was used as a
meeting house on each Sabbath, the officiating ministers being
obtained alternately from Bispham and Poulton, and occasionally
from amongst the visitors themselves.</p>

<p>In 1799, the poorer inhabitants of Blackpool and its neighbourhood
suffered severely, in common with others, from a failure in the
grain and potato harvests. They, like most members of the
working classes at that date, relied almost entirely upon good and
plentiful crops of these important articles of diet, to furnish them
with the means of sustenance throughout the year, so that a small
yield, raising the prices exorbitantly, became a matter of serious
moment to them, and in most instances, meant little less than
ruin or starvation. After the cold and inclement approach of
winter had banished the last stranger from their midst, the sums
demanded for their accustomed provisions soon swallowed up the
little these people had saved during the summer, and such
occasional trifles as could be earned on the farm lands around
whenever extra services were required. Their condition, deplorable
from the first, gradually grew worse, until, reduced to the deepest
distress, they became dependent for the bare necessaries of existence
upon the charity of those whose positions, although seriously
affected by the failure, were not placed in such great jeopardy as
their own. After this precarious and pitiable state of things had
lasted some time without any signs of amelioration, and it seemed
difficult, if not impossible, to conjecture how the remaining months
were to be provided for until the returning season brought fresh
assistance to their homes, an unexpected, and, to them, providential
occurrence relieved their sufferings. A large vessel laden with
peas was wrecked upon the coast, and the cargo, washing out of
the hold, was strewn upon the beach, supplying them with
abundance of food until better days shone upon the impoverished
village once more.</p>

<p>Reviewing the appearance of Blackpool at the opening of the
nineteenth century we find that the whole hamlet was comprised<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326"></a>[326]</span>
between the Gynn to the north, and the ruins of the once
aristocratic mansion of Fox Hall to the south. The houses with the
exception of Bonny’s Hotel and a few scattered cottages, had all
been erected along the sea bank, the great bulk lying to the south
of Forshaw’s Hotel, and amounting to about thirty, whilst the
space north of that spot as far as Bailey’s Hotel was only occupied
by one or two dwellings of very humble dimensions. These with
the Gynn and a few habitations standing south of it on Fumbler’s
Hill, made up the number of houses to about forty. A
detailed description of the different erections at that epoch is
impossible, but we may state generally that those of modern origin,
especially the hotels, although unpretending externally, were so
arranged and provided that the comforts of the guests were fully
insured, and in every way the accommodation they offered was
immensely superior to any that could have been obtained thirty
years before. The few old buildings that still remained had for
the most part undergone considerable alterations, and been rendered
more suitable for the purposes to which they were now devoted.</p>

<p>In 1801 the first official census of the inhabitants of the township
of Layton-cum-Warbreck, in which Blackpool is situated, was
taken, and furnished a total of 473 persons.</p>

<p>At that period many people attracted by the rising reputation of
the watering-place were anxious to invest their capital in the
purchase of land by its shores, and in the erection of houses
adapted for the reception of visitors, but the proprietors of the
hotels were the owners of a large portion of the soil, and fearing
that the introduction of substantial and commodious apartments
would interfere with the patronage of their inns, refused to dispose
of any part of their lands, or at least placed such obstacles in the
way of the would-be purchasers that bargains were seldom
concluded. Had it not been for the energy and foresight displayed
by one resident, Mr. H. Banks, who built several cottages and
fitted them up with every convenience and requisite for summer
dwellings, the prosperity of the village would have received a
sudden check and doubtless a serious injury, for the provision
made would have fallen far short of the requirements of an ever-increasing
throng of visitors, and thus repeated disappointments
would in the end have led to disgust and the absence of many
when the following seasons rolled round. The probability of such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327"></a>[327]</span>
a disastrous result seems at length to have been realised by the
landlords themselves, who discovered that the plan to enlarge their
own business was not to drive visitors away from the place by
limiting the accommodation, but to offer them every inducement
to come, and to have a sufficiency of houses ready to receive them
when they had arrived. Under this new and more liberal
impression greater facilities were offered both to purchasers of land
and builders, so that the early error into which they had fallen
was rectified before any great amount of harm had been done.</p>

<p>During the summer of 1808 the Preston volunteers were on
duty at Blackpool for two weeks, and on the 4th of June celebrated
the seventieth birthday of His Majesty George III. with
many demonstrations of loyalty and rejoicing.</p>

<p>The small town now boasted five good class hotels, which, in
their order from north to south, were named Dickson’s, Forshaw’s,
Bank’s, Simpson’s, and the Yorkshire House. Simpson’s, formerly
Hull’s, is now the Royal Hotel; Bank’s the Land Ends Hotel, and
Dickson’s was the one already mentioned as Bailey’s Hotel.
“Adjoining Forshaw’s Hotel,” writes a gentleman who visited
Blackpool about that date; “there are two or three houses of
genteel appearance, compared with the many small cottages
leading thence to the street, which is the principal entrance from
Preston. There is a promenade with an arbour at the end of it,
and beyond it nearer to Dixon’s Hotel stands a cottage used as a
warm bath. Beyond Dixon’s there is a public road where two
four-wheeled vehicles can pass each other.” At a later period
both the road and cottage alluded to had succumbed to the
unchecked power of the advancing sea; and here it will be convenient
to mention other and much more serious encroachments
made by the same element in the course of years now long gone
by. We can scarcely conceive, when gazing on the indolent deep
in its placid mood, that at any time it could have been possessed
with such a demon of fury and destruction as to swallow up
broad fields, acres upon acres, of the foreland of the Fylde, and in
its blind anger sweep away whole villages, levelling the house
walls and uprooting the very foundations, so that no trace or
vestige of their former existence should remain. History, however,
points to a hamlet called Waddum Thorp, which once stood
off the coast of Lytham, fenced from the sea by a broad area<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328"></a>[328]</span>
of green pasture-land, now known as the Horse-bank; and in
more recent years a long range of star-hills ran southward from
opposite the Royal Hotel, protecting a highway, fields, and four
or five cottages from the waves, whilst a little further north a
boat-house afterwards a shoemaker’s shop, stood in the centre of a
grassy plot, all of which have vanished, and their sites are now
covered and obliterated by the sand and pebbles of the beach.
The several roads, which had been formed at different seasons,
leading over the cliffs to Bispham, were sapped away and
destroyed so rapidly by the incursions of the tide that one more
inland and circuitous was obliged to be made. On the sands,
about three miles to the north of Blackpool, and so far distant
from the shore that it is only visible when the water has receded
to its lowest ebb, stands the famous Penny-stone. Near the spot
marked by the huge boulder, tradition affirms that in days of yore
there existed a small road-side inn, celebrated far and wide for its
strong ale, which was retailed at one penny per pot, and that
whilst the thirsty traveller was refreshing himself within, and
listening to the gossip of “mine host,” his horse was tethered to
an iron ring fixed in this stone. It is stated that documents
relating to the ancient hostelry are still preserved, but as the
assertion is unsupported by any evidence of its veracity, we are
prohibited from accepting it as conclusive proof that the inn owes
its reputed existence to something more substantial than the
lively imaginations of our ancestors. There is, certainly, one
thing which gives some colouring of possibility, or perhaps, out of
veneration for the antiquity of the tradition, we may advance a
step and say, reasonable probability, to the story, and that is
the historic fact, that at no very great distance from the locality
there stood a village called Singleton Thorp until 1555, when it
was submerged and annihilated by a sudden and fearful irruption
of the sea. Several other boulders of various sizes are lying about
in the neighbourhood of Penny-stone, bearing the names of Old
Mother’s Head, Bear and Staff, Carlin and its Colts, Higher and
Lower Jingle, each of which is covered in a greater or less degree
with shells, corallines, anemonies, and other treasures of the
deep.</p>

<p>In 1811 the census of the persons residing in the township
before specified, was again taken, and amounted to 580, showing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329"></a>[329]</span>
an increase of 107 in the number of inhabitants during the
preceding ten years.</p>

<p>The year 1816 is remarkable as being the first in which public
coaches ran regularly between Preston and Blackpool. Previously
the chief communication between the village and outlying places
had been by means of pack-horses, carts, and private vehicles, with
only occasional coaches.</p>

<p>The following description of Blackpool about the year 1816
was furnished by one of its oldest inhabitants, and, although
unavoidably entailing some repetition of what has been mentioned
before, will, we trust, be interesting in itself, as well as useful in
confirming the earlier parts of this history, which have necessarily
been compiled from previous writings on the subject, and
not from the evidence of living witnesses. The Gynn House
formed the most northerly boundary of the village, and, passing
from that hostelry in a southerly direction, the next dwelling
arrived at was Hill-farm, which still exists, and is at present used
as a laundry for the Imperial Hotel. A few gabled cottages stood
on the eminence called Fumbler’s Hill, near the site of Carleton
Terrace:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Old Ned, and Old Nanny, at Fumbler’s hill,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Will board you and lodge you e’en just as you will.”<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">These cottages faced the south, as indeed did all the other
dwellings at that time, with the exception of two or three of the
hotels and a few of the more recent buildings. Bailey’s, or rather
Dickson’s, Hotel was built in blocks of two and three stories, and
possessed one bay window. It must be remembered that the
stories of that day were much lower than those with which
modern improvements have made us familiar. The next hotel
was Forshaw’s, similar in its construction, but unadorned with
even one bay window; between these two large inns were two or
three small thatched cottages. Continuing our survey southwards
were Dobson’s Row, consisting of several slated cottages, with a
circulating library and billiard room; and the Lane Ends Hotel,
containing three bay-windows, built, like the others, in
parts of two and three stories each. In Lane Ends Street there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330"></a>[330]</span>
was a general shop and lodging house combined, tenanted by a
person named Nickson. The Royal, then commonly called
the Houndhill Hotel, comes next in order, and a little distance
behind it on the rising ground was a small thatched cottage for
the reception of visitors. South Beach contained only a few
thatched cottages, and on the site of the present Wellington Hotel
stood a circular pinfold, built of cobble stone. Considerably west
of the present line of frontage, and south of the pinfold, stood two
rows of cottages almost on the edge of the shore; the last of these
habitations was washed away or pulled down in 1827. Beyond the
Yorkshire House and its bowling green was the dilapidated
remains of Fox Hall, part of which had been converted into a
small farm-cottage, in the occupation of a person named Wignall.
Between Fox Hall and the Yorkshire House, but further removed
from the beach, was a thatched cottage adjoining a stable, in which
Mr. Butcher, of Raikes Hall, kept two or three racehorses, the field
now occupied by the Manchester Hotel being used as an exercise
ground for them. Chapel Street contained a small farm-house
and several cottages, in addition to Bonny’s Hotel, which was
situated in a field at the lower end of this lane. In Church Street
there were only three or four cottages, two of which, standing at
the south-west corner, were slated and used as shops. A few
other cottages, whose exact sites could not be recalled with
accuracy, were scattered here and there, but the above will furnish
the reader with a fairly correct idea of the extent and appearance
of Blackpool about the year 1816.</p>

<p>The National Schools, at Raikes Hill, were the first provision
made for the education of the young, and were built in 1817,
chiefly through the exertions of Mr. Gisborne, then a temporary
resident. They consist of two schools, for boys and girls respectively,
with a teachers’ home between. The accommodation has
since been considerably enlarged and the institution is now under
government inspection.</p>

<p>The parish church of St. John, in course of erection in 1820,
was built with bricks from a croft situated on the cliffs between
Dickson’s Hotel and the promenade. This place of worship,
originally an episcopal chapel under Bispham, with a perpetual
curacy attached, was consecrated to St. John on July 6th, 1821,
by Doctor Law, bishop of Chester. In 1860 a special district was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331"></a>[331]</span>
assigned by order of Council to St. John’s, which in that manner
became, under Lord Blanford’s Act, the parish church of Blackpool.
The district thus cut off from the wide parochial area of Bispham,
and constituted a distinct parish for all ecclesiastical purposes, was
included between the Spen Dyke to the south and the central line
of Talbot road to the north. The cost of the sacred edifice,
which consisted, externally, of a plain brick structure, having a
low embattled tower with pinnacles at the angles, amounted
to £1,072, the whole of which was defrayed by voluntary
subscriptions, the following individuals being the principal contributors:—</p>

<p>The interior of the church, plain and neat, was lighted by small
lamps for evening service during the winter, and contained a font
which had once belonged to the old Roman Catholic chapel of
Singleton; and, a few years later, an organ built by Wren, of
Manchester. In 1832 this building was enlarged by drawing out
the east end, into which a plain window was inserted. The still
increasing popularity of the watering place demanded another
enlargement, which took place in 1847; but it was not until 1851
that the present chancel, containing a handsome stained glass
memorial window to H. Banks, esq., who died in 1847, was added.
The window embraces representations of Christ, the four
evangelists, and the infant Jesus, with Joseph and his mother, etc.,
below which is the following inscription, surmounted by a coat of
arms and motto:—“In memoriam Henrii Banks de Blackpool
patris, et unius ex hujus Ædis patronis, tres sui liberi hanc
fenestram fieri fecerunt.” In 1862 it was thought desirable that
further improvements should be made, and an open domed roof of
pitch-pine was substituted for the old ceiling; the floors of the
pews, previously covered with asphalt, were boarded; new
windows of ground glass, and a fresh pulpit and reading desk were
added to the church; whilst a substantial iron railing was erected
round the yard in place of the cobble wall, which had stood since
the opening of the edifice, and in the same year the burial space<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332"></a>[332]</span>
was increased by including the plot of land lying to the west of
the church, and now abutting on the houses of Abingdon Street.
Four years later, in 1866, a new and larger tower, furnished with a
clock and a peal of eight bells, was completed on the site of
the original one, which had been pulled down for this purpose. The
interior of the church contains, in addition to the memorial
window already alluded to, mural tablets <i>in memoriam</i> of Robert
Banks, gent., died May 27th, 1838, aged 76 years,—“Ever mindful
of the calls of general duty, he was also a liberal promoter of the
erection and endowment of this church, and by will bequeathed the
sum of £100, for the perpetual support of the national school”;
Edward, the son of Henry and Margaret Banks, died August 8th,
1845, aged 35 years; the Rev. Thomas Banks, “who was for
thirty-five years incumbent of Singleton church, and an eminent
instructor of youth,” died 1842, aged 73 years.</p>

<p>The present patrons of St. John’s church are the Rev. C.
Hesketh, of North Meols; the Vicar of Bispham; J. Talbot Clifton,
esq., of Lytham Hall; and the Raikes Hall Park, Gardens, and
Aquarium Company.</p>

<p>In 1821 the census returns of the population of Layton-with-Warbreck
showed a total of 749 persons. On the 19th of July
in that year the coronation of George IV. was celebrated by the
inhabitants and visitors of Blackpool “in a manner most grateful
to every benevolent heart.” A handsome subscription, we are told<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333"></a>[333]</span>
by the gentleman whose words have just been quoted and who
was present on the occasion, was expended in procuring one day’s
festivity for the poor and needy, the aged and the young. About
ten in the morning, the children of the township, amounting to
one hundred and thirty-nine, assembled at the national school,
erected near the church, where they were each presented with
a coronation medal. Afterwards they paraded the beach, headed
by two musicians, and sang the national anthem at all the
principal houses, followed by ringing cheers; returning to
the school-house, each child was regaled with a large bun, and
spiced ale and coppers were distributed amongst them. When these
had been dismissed to their homes, upwards of thirty old people
met in the same room, where they sat down to an ample and
excellent dinner, at the conclusion of which they each drank the
king’s health in a pint of strong ale. The same kind-hearted
ladies who had superintended the children in the procession,
waited on this venerable company, and had their generosity
rewarded by witnessing the amusing spectacle of three old women,
upwards of seventy, who had probably danced at the coronation
of George III., go through a Scotch reel, which they accomplished
in excellent style.</p>

<p>On the 21st of March, 1825, the first stone of a small Independent
chapel, situated at the lower end of Chapel Street, and lying on
the south extremity of the village, was laid by the Rev. D. T.
Carnson, and on the 6th of the ensuing July it was opened
for public worship by the Rev. Dr. Raffles.</p>

<p>The summer of 1827 is remarkable as having been an exceptionally
prosperous season for Blackpool; vast numbers of carts
and other vehicles laden with their living freights arrived from
Blackburn, Burnley, Colne, Padiham, and the borders of Yorkshire,
and during the month of August so crowded was the place
that many were lodged in stables and barns, whilst others sought
refuge at Poulton. The following year a fine gravel promenade
was tastefully laid out on the sea bank to a considerable distance,
occupying a large portion of the site of the old road. A beautiful
green turf walk was constructed from the beach to the church,
leading through pleasant fields, and furnished at intervals with
covered seats. The Albion Hotel was also erected at the north-west
corner of Lane Ends Street.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334"></a>[334]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Whittle, in his publication descriptive, amongst other
resorts, of Blackpool in 1830, and entitled “Marina,” says:—“Blackpool
is furnished with excellent accommodation, although
it is a pity but what there had been some kind of uniformity
observed, as all sea-bathing stations ought to have their houses
built upon a plan entirely unique. Four assemblies have been
known to take place in one week during the bathing season,
extending from July to October. In fact the rooms at the hotels
are very extensive. Bank’s is the most commodious. The
inhabitants seem to have no taste for ornamenting their doorways
or windows with trellis work or verandahs, or with jessamines,
woodbines, or hollyhocks, similar to those at Southport,
and many of the sea-bathing situations in the south. It is not to
be wondered at that there are here frequently at the flux of the
season, from eight hundred to a thousand visitors. Blackpool has
most certainly been honoured since its commencement as a
watering-place by persons of distinction and fashion. The hotels
and other houses of reception are scattered along the beach with
an aspect towards the Irish Sea; and in the rear are the dwellings
of the villagers. The cottages on the beach have of late years
considerably increased, and they serve, with the hotels in the
centre, to give the place, when viewed from the sea, a large and
imposing appearance.”</p>

<p>The ball and dining-room at Nickson’s Hotel, (the Clifton Arms,)
was of large dimensions, and contained a neat orchestra at one
end, whilst the following notice was suspended in a prominent
position against the inner wall:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The friends of Cuthbert Nickson will please to observe that the senior person
at the hotel is entitled to the president’s chair; and the junior to the vice-president’s.
Also the ladies to have the preference of the bathing machines.”</p>

</div>

<p>Placards, similar in their import to this one, were to be seen
in both Dickson’s and Bank’s Hotels.</p>

<p>The new promenade was improved in 1830 by the addition of a
wooden hand-rail along its entire length, whilst comfortable seats
were placed opposite the hotels of Banks and Nickson. The fairs,
to which we have already alluded, continued to be held every second
Sunday during the season, but a few years later they were
abolished by the action of the more respectable portion of the
residents. Letters arrived at half-past eleven in the morning, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335"></a>[335]</span>
were despatched at noon, daily in the summer months, but only
three times a week during winter. Mr. Cook, an American, was
the originator of the post, which he commenced some time before
by having the letters carried to Kirkham three times a week
during the season. At that day the arrival of the letter-bag was
made known to the anxious public by exposing a board on which
was written or painted, “The post is arrived.” This ingenious
device proclaimed, on reversing the board, “The post is not yet
arrived;” so that by a proper use of the signal the postmaster
was enabled to save himself much trouble in answering the frequent
inquiries of expectant visitors. Mr. Cook, who is described as
having been the “Beau Nash” of Blackpool, died in 1820, and
was buried at Bispham. The charges at the best hotels were
6s. per day in private and 5s. in public, with an addition of 1s.
each night for a front, or 6d. for a back, bedroom. At Bonny’s
the price was 4s. 6d. per day; and at Nickson’s and the Yorkshire
House 3s. 6d. per day at the first table, and 2s. 6d. at the second,
subject to an additional charge for extra attendance if required.</p>

<p>The census returns of 1831 showed that the population of the
township had increased to 943 persons since 1821, when, the
reader may be reminded, the total amounted to 749.</p>

<p>In 1835, a Wesleyan chapel, calculated to hold between 250
and 300 persons, was erected and opened in Bank Hey Street.
This building, having in the course of time become inadequate
for the accommodation of its increasing congregation, was
pulled down, and the corner stone of the present edifice laid by
W. Heap, esq., of Halifax, on Friday, November 1st., 1861. The
chapel, which occupies a site near the old one, was opened for
service on the 4th of July, 1862, and is capable of seating 760
persons. The total expenditure for the erection and other
incidental expenses connected with it, amounted to £3,500. An
organ, built by Mr. E. Wadsworth, of Manchester, at a cost of
£320, was obtained in 1872.</p>

<p>During 1836 great improvements were made in the appearance
of the town; shops were beautified and increased in
number; many of the cottages were rendered more ornamental,
whilst others were constructed on modern principles, and on a
moderate calculation it may be estimated that two hundred
beds were added to the existing accommodation. Sir Benjamin<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336"></a>[336]</span>
Heywood, bart., of Claremont, purchased an extensive plot
of land, now occupied by the Prince of Wales’s Market and
Aquarium Buildings, on which he shortly afterwards raised
a handsome marine family residence, called West Hey.
Numerous and copious springs of fine fresh water were found at
a depth of fifteen yards from the surface; until which fortunate
discovery, water for drinking purposes had been collected in
cisterns dug out of the marl. Public Baths were also erected on
the beach adjoining the Lane Ends Hotel.</p>

<p>The following year, 1837, the Victoria Terrace and Promenade,
erected at the north-west corner of Victoria Street, were completed.
This block of buildings was formed of seven shops, above them
being the Promenade, a room thirty-two yards long, which
opened through folding windows upon a balcony six feet wide;
attached to it were a news-room, library, and billiard table. The
Promenade acquired its distinctive title from being first used on
the 24th of May, 1837, when the Princess Victoria, the present
Queen, attained her legal majority; on that day the principal
inhabitants of Blackpool assembled there to celebrate the important
event with a sumptuous dinner, and from the subjoined extract,
taken from an account of the gathering in a public print, we
learn the great estimation in which the saloon was then held:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“ ... dinner and excellent wine provided by Mr. C. Nickson, to which
fifty-two gentlemen sat down, in the splendid Promenade Room newly erected by
Doctor Cocker, who was highly extolled for his taste in the architectural design
and decorations of the building, which is of the chaste Doric order, and for his
spirited liberality in providing the visitors of this celebrated resort with so spacious
and magnificent a saloon, where, as in a common centre, they may meet each other
and enjoy the social pleasures of a <i>conversatione</i> whenever they please; thus
evincing his wish to promote a more friendly intercourse amongst the strangers
collected here from all quarters of the kingdom during the summer season—this
has hitherto been a <i>desideratum</i> at Blackpool.”</p>

</div>

<p>For long afterwards balls and all public meetings were held in
this assembly room, which still exists in its original condition,
although the other parts of the block, especially the shops, have
recently been improved and beautified.</p>

<p>From 1837 to 1840 the progress of the place was steady, but
not rapid, as compared with more recent times. In the latter
year the opening of the Preston and Wyre Railway to Poulton,
initiated a mode of travelling until then unknown in the Fylde<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337"></a>[337]</span>
district, and by its means Blackpool became nearer in point of
time to Preston, Manchester, and many other large towns already
possessing railway accommodation, a great accession of company
being the immediate result. Omnibuses, coaches, and other
carriages met every train at Poulton station, and the four miles of
road were scampered over by splendid teams in less than half an
hour. Then it was that the jolting, homely vehicles, and the
through coaches, which had for long been the dashing wonders of
the country roads, were driven off, and a greatly multiplied
number of visitors brought into the town daily by the more
expeditious route, at a less cost and with greater personal convenience
than had been possible in earlier days. More accommodation
was soon called for and as readily supplied by the
spirited inhabitants, who erected numerous houses at several
points, which served, at no distant period, as the nucleus for new
streets and terraces. The census of the township in 1841 had
risen to 2,168. In 1844 the erection and opening of a Market House,
evinced the growing importance and prosperity of the watering-place;
this building has lately, since 1872, been enlarged by lateral
extension to quite double its original capacity, whilst the extensive
unprotected area opposite, used for similar trading purposes and
occupied by stalls, has been covered over with a transparent roof.
Talbot Road was opened out and the lower end formed into a
spacious square, (furnished with an elegant drinking fountain in 1870)
by the removal of a house from its centre. These improvements
were effected at the sole cost of John Talbot Clifton, esq., of
Lytham, the owner of the soil. The Adelphi and Victoria Hotels,
which had sprung into being, were altered and enlarged; the
former by raising it a story, and the latter by the addition of a
commodious dining room, two sitting rooms, and sundry bedrooms.
Several spacious residences were finished on South Beach, and
a handsome terrace of habitations stretching south from Dickson’s
Hotel, was also erected about that time.</p>

<p>In 1845, several houses on a larger scale, including the Talbot
Hotel, were built, and great improvements and additions made to
many former establishments.</p>

<p>The opening of the branch line from Blackpool to join the main
railroad at Poulton, on the 29th of April, 1846, gave another marked
impetus to the progress of the town; by its formation direct steam<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338"></a>[338]</span>
communication was completed with the populous centres of Lancashire
and Yorkshire, and many, who had previously been
deterred from visiting Blackpool by its comparative inaccessibility,
now flocked down to its shores in great numbers; building increased,
and dwellings arose, chiefly on the front, and in Church
and Victoria Streets.</p>

<p>During the ensuing year the first meeting of the Blackpool Agricultural
Society was held on the grounds of a recently built inn,
the Manchester Hotel, at South Shore; the attendance was both
numerous and respectable, including many of the most influential
gentlemen, yeomen, and farmers of the neighbourhood, and several
from the remoter localities of the Fylde. Cows, horses, and pigs
appear to have been the only stocks to which prizes were awarded.
The first Lodge of Freemasons held their initiatory meeting in
that year at the Beach Hotel, another house of entertainment
which had risen shortly before, on the site of some furnished
cottage facing the beach.</p>

<p>A new Independent Chapel was commenced in Victoria Street,
to supersede the small one erected in Chapel Street in 1825; the
edifice was finished and used for divine service in 1849. Serious
differences seem to have arisen a few years later between the pastor
of that date, the Rev. J. Noall, and a limited section of his congregation,
who were anxious to deprive him of his charge, and even
went so far, in 1860, as to publicly read in the chapel, after
morning service, a notice convening a meeting for that purpose.
This act, being repeated on the ensuing Sabbath, led to retaliation
on the part of the partizans of the minister, who, unknown to
that gentleman, paraded three figures, intended to represent the
three principal opponents to the continuance of his pastorate, suspended
from a gibbet, which had been erected in a cart, through
the streets of the town, and afterwards gave them up to the flames
on the sands. The Rev. J. Noall was shortly afterwards presented
with a testimonial of esteem by a number of sympathisers.
Schools, in connection with the chapel, were built in 1870.</p>

<p>Two years subsequently, the watering-place had grown, without
the fostering care of a public governing body, into a large and
prosperous town, boasting a resident population of over two
thousand persons, but this very increase and popularity had
rendered it impossible for private enterprise to provide the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339"></a>[339]</span>
requisite comforts and conveniences for such a mixture of classes
as visited it during the summer. Acting under this necessity and
for the welfare of the resort a Local Board was formed, composed
of gentlemen elected from amongst inhabitants, into whose hands
was entrusted the government and regulation of all matters connected
with the place. An accession of power was sought in 1853,
and on Tuesday, the 14th of June, the Blackpool Improvement
Act received the royal assent. The Board originally consisted
of nine members, but in 1871 the number was increased to
eighteen.</p>

<p>One of the earliest acts of the new commissioners of 1853 was to
provide for the proper lighting of the town by the erection of Gas
Works, which they accomplished in their first year of office; for
some time it had been evident that the season was seriously curtailed
by the absence of any illumination along the promenade and
thoroughfares during the autumn evenings, but private speculation
had for some reason held aloof from so important an undertaking,
although the question had been much discussed amongst
the inhabitants. Here it may be stated, in order to avoid reverting
to the subject again, that in 1863 there were 650 consumers
of gas; in 1869, 1270; and in 1875, no less than 2,000; the
miles of mains in those years being respectively 5, 7, and 12.</p>

<p>In 1856, the promenade, which had suffered much injury from
frequent attacks of the sea, and perhaps from some amount of
negligence in not bestowing due attention to its proper maintenance,
was put in better order and extended from its northern extremity,
opposite Talbot Square, along the front of Albert Terrace
as far as Rossall’s, formerly Dickson’s Hotel. Four years later a
portion of this walk opposite Central Beach was asphalted and
sprinkled over with fine white spar. The Infant School-house in
Bank Hey Street, was opened in 1856.</p>

<p>The Roman Catholic Church, situated in Talbot Road, was
erected in 1857, from the design of Edwin W. Pugin, Esq., and at
the sole expense of Miss M. Tempest, sister to Sir Charles Tempest,
Bart., of Broughton Hall, Yorkshire. It is in the Gothic style,
the exterior being built with Yorkshire flag in narrow courses,
hammer dressed and tuck pointed. The church comprises a
chancel, north and south transepts, two sacristies, confessionals,
nave, aisles, south porch, and central western tower. The chancel,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340"></a>[340]</span>
which is separated from the nave and transepts by a richly
decorated and moulded arch, contains four side windows in addition
to a large one at the east end. The nave is divided into five bays
of fifteen feet each, with massive arches ornamented with deeply
cut mouldings. The tower is of great solidity, and rises to a
height of one hundred and twenty-four feet. Almost the whole
of the windows are filled with richly stained glass; and the altar
within the chancel is beautified with elaborately carved groups,
designed by J. H. Powell, of Birmingham, of the “Agony in the
Garden,” and the “Last Supper;” whilst that in the lady chapel
is adorned, from the pencil of the same artist, with illustrations of
the “Assumption of the Virgin,” and the “Annunciation,” all of
which are exquisitely carved by Lane. This church is dedicated
to the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary, and was the first one ever
erected in Blackpool for members of the Roman Catholic Faith,
service having been previously celebrated in a room in Talbot
Road. In 1866 an excellent peal of cast steel bells was added to
the tower; and ten years afterwards a magnificent organ was
opened in the main building. Attached to the church, and within
the same enclosure, were placed day and Sunday schools, as well
as a residence for the officiating priests. The cost of this
magnificent pile, without the internal decorations, amounted to
£5,500.</p>

<p>The foundation stone of the Union Baptist Chapel, in Abingdon
Street, was laid on the 9th of April, 1860, and on Good Friday
in the following year it was opened for divine worship by the Rev.
Dr. Raffles. The main building, 80 feet long by 49 feet wide, is
of brick, and finished with moulded and polished stone dressings
in the Grecian style of architecture. The principal or west front
is surmounted by a bold cornice and pediment, and contains the
two chief entrances, which are approached by a long range of
steps and a spacious landing. The interior is fitted with substantial
open pews of red pine in the body, and similar seats are placed in
the two end galleries, the whole being capable of providing
accommodation for about 650 persons. The communion floor,
under a portion of which is the Baptistry, is enclosed with an
ornamental balustrade. The edifice is well supplied with light
through plain circular-headed windows. A Sunday school was
added in 1874, and an organ also purchased during that year.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341"></a>[341]</span>
From 1858 to the completion of the chapel the Baptists
worshipped in the room formerly used by the Roman Catholics
in Talbot Road.</p>

<p>In 1861, the progress and improvement of the town was well
shown by three events which occurred at that date—the first sod
of the Lytham and Blackpool coast line was cut at Lytham Park,
on the 4th of September; a large Market Hall, raised on South
Beach, by Mr. W. Read, for the sale of useful and fancy articles
was completed; and the original Christ Church was opened on
Sunday the 23rd of June, by the Rev. C. H. Wainwright, M.A.
This church, which stood until the erection of the present one,
was built of iron by Mr. Hemming, of London, at a cost of £1,000,
which was advanced by eight gentlemen, who were subsequently
reimbursed by contributions from the public and collections from
the congregation at various times.</p>

<p>The population of Layton-with-Warbreck in 1861 amounted to
3,907 persons, of which number Blackpool contributed 3,506.</p>

<p>The passenger traffic on the Blackpool and Lytham Railway
commenced on the 6th of April, 1862, and between that date and
the 30th of June over 35,000 persons had taken advantage of the
line and been conveyed between the two watering-places. In
1862 a handsome Police Station and Court-House sprang into
being in Abingdon street, including residences, lock-ups, offices,
magistrates’ room, etc.</p>

<p>The streets of Blackpool no longer presented the meagre and
broken lines of earlier days, but were in most instances well filled
on each side with compact blocks of houses. In December, 1861,
a few of the townpeople assembled at the Clifton Arms Hotel to
consider the advisability of erecting a pier, to extend westward
from the promenade opposite Talbot square; and on the 22nd of
January, 1862, the memorandum of association was signed with a
capital of £12,000, being immediately registered. Plans were
examined on the 10th of February, and the design of E. Birch,
esq., C.E., selected, that gentleman being also appointed engineer.
In April, the tender of Messrs. Laidlaw, of Glasgow, to construct
the pier for £11,540 was accepted; and a grant of the foreshore
required for the undertaking having been obtained from the
Duchy of Lancaster for £120, and £7 paid to the Crown for the
portion beyond low-water mark, the first pile of the North Pier<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342"></a>[342]</span>
was screwed into the marl on the 27th of June, 1862, by Captain
Francis Preston, the chairman of the company. A violent storm
in the ensuing October damaged the works to some extent, and
induced the company to raise the deck of the pier three feet above
the altitude originally proposed, at an expense of £2,000. On the
21st of May, 1863, the pier was formally opened by Captain
Preston, the auspicious event being celebrated by general
rejoicings throughout the town and a procession of the different
schools and friendly societies. The dimensions of the erection at
that date were:—Approach, 80 feet long; abutment, 120 feet long
and 45 feet wide; main portion, 1,070 feet long and 28 feet wide;
and the head, 135 feet long and 55 feet wide, giving a total length
of 1,405 feet available as a promenade. The entire superstructure
was placed upon clusters of iron piles, fixed vertically into the
ground by means of screws, those at the abutment and main body
being wholly of cast, and those at the head partly of cast and
partly of wrought iron. The largest of the cast-iron columns
measured 12 inches in diameter, and 1⅓ inch in thickness, each
column being filled in with concrete. The piles were arranged
in clusters at intervals of 60 feet, and firmly secured together
longitudinally, transversely, and diagonally, by rods and braces.
The main girders, of the sort known as plated, were rivetted on
the clusters in lengths of 70 feet, and formed parapets, presenting
a pleasing appearance and constituting a most efficient wind
guard to the pier. The tops of the girders were turned to useful
account by converting them into a continuous line of seats. Next
to the chief girders were fixed transverse wrought iron girders,
upon the top of which the planking of the deck was laid, being
arranged in longitudinal and transverse layers, so that no open
spaces were left to admit the passage of wind or spray. The head
of the pier, rectangular in form, was raised 50 feet above low-water
mark, and leading from it to ample landing stages below,
was a flight of steps 10 feet wide. The limits of the pier shore-wards
were defined by ornamental iron gates with lamps,
immediately inside which were the toll houses. Upon the main
portion of the pier were erected several ornamental shelter and
refreshment houses of an octagonal shape, and standing on side
projections. Another ornamental shelter house of much larger
dimensions was placed, within a few months, on the head. Lamps<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343"></a>[343]</span>
were provided along the entire length of the pier. In 1867 the
directors determined to erect an iron extension or jetty, and in
less than two years the work was accomplished at a cost of £6,000.
During the month of May, 1869, a tender for the formation of the
present entrance for £2,700 was accepted, and the agreement
promptly carried out by Messrs. Laidlaw, of Glasgow. In
October, 1874, the company arranged with the same contractors
to enlarge the pierhead by putting out two wings, from the
designs of E. Birch, esq., C.E., at an expenditure of £14,000. On
the north wing it is intended to build a pavilion, 130 feet long by
90 feet wide, in an eastern style of architecture, and estimated to
hold 1,200 persons seated. The edifice, around which there will
be a promenade, is to be supplied with an orchestra, refreshment
rooms, etc., and used as a concert room and fashionable marine
lounge. The south wing, which is about 130 feet long, contains
a bandstand, capable of holding 30 performers, at the further
end, and on the east and west side two other buildings 62
feet by 27 feet each, the former being designed for the purposes
of a restaurant, and the latter for the sale of fancy goods and
other commodities. The unoccupied space, nearly 100 feet by 80
feet, will be provided with seats in the centre, the remainder
serving as a promenade. The contract for the foregoing erections
was let in 1875, to Messrs. Robert Neill and Sons, of Manchester,
for nearly £12,000. In 1863, the capital of the company was
raised to £15,000; in 1864, to £20,000; in 1865, to £25,000;
in 1874, to £40,000; and in 1875, to £50,000.</p>

<p>About the period when the North Pier was constructed, and
for years previously, the visitors to Blackpool could certainly
complain of no lack of ordinary amusements during their brief
residence by the sea. Horses, donkeys, and vehicles were ever
in readiness to administer to their entertainment, either by
conveying them for short drives to explore such objects of
interest as the country afforded, or translating them for the day
to the seaport of Fleetwood, or the neighbouring resort of
Lytham. Bathing machines abounded on the sands, and during
suitable states of the tide were busily engaged in affording ready
access to the briny element to numbers, who were anxious to
experience the invigorating effects of a bath in Neptune’s domain.
In the evenings theatrical representations were frequently held,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344"></a>[344]</span>
since 1861, in the spacious room of Read’s Market. The Crystal
Palace, formerly the Victoria Promenade, was also devoted to
similar purposes, having long been diverted from the use for
which it was first intended. The Number 3 Hotel, under its old
name, but in a more modern building than that described by Mr.
Hutton at the close of last century, still flourished, and proved
equally attractive, not so much, however, on account of its “fine
ale” as the wealth of strawberries and floral beauties adorning its
gardens. Carleton Terrace was built in 1863; and on the 10th of
March in that year the marriage of the Prince of Wales and the
Princess Alexandra of Denmark, was celebrated with many
manifestations of loyalty and joy. Flags, banners, and ensigns
were suspended from the windows of almost every house, whilst
sports of various kinds were held on the sands during the
morning, after which the school children, belonging to the
different denominations, and a body of Oddfellows, amounting in
all to 900 persons, assembled in Talbot Square, and sang the
national anthem, previous to forming a procession and parading
the streets of the town. Subsequently the children were regaled
with tea, buns, etc. The Preston Banking Company established
a branch at Blackpool during 1863; and in the month of January
a party of gentlemen purchased the whole of the land lying
between the site of Carleton terrace and the Gynn, for the
purpose of laying it out in building plots and promenades, the
main feature to be a large central hotel standing in its own
grounds. The contracts were let by the company in October, 1863,
for embanking, sewering, and forming the necessary roads and
promenades on their estate, and shortly afterwards an agreement
was entered into for preparing the foundation of the hotel, the
work in both instances being promptly commenced. The
magnitude of the scheme far exceeded that of any undertaking
which had ever yet been attempted in Blackpool, but undisturbed
by the speculative character of their venture the proprietors
carried the enterprise through its various phases with a liberal
and vigorous hand, succeeding in the course of time in creating
an acquisition of incalculable beauty and benefit to the town.
The Imperial Hotel has its station on the highest point of the
land, now called Claremont Park, and is a palatial edifice,
surrounded by elegant lawns and walks, walled off from the park<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345"></a>[345]</span>
outside. In 1876 an extensive enlargement, consisting of a south
wing, containing 39 bedrooms and 6 sitting-rooms, was made to
the establishment. The cliffs fronting the estate, formerly rugged
and uneven, were sloped and pitched to form a protection from
the inroads of the tide, whilst a broad marine promenade was
made along the whole length of the park, about a mile, and fenced
with an iron railing on its open aspect. The main promenade of
the town was continued round the west side of the park as far as
the Gynn, but on a lower level than the walk just indicated.
Shrubs were planted and toll houses, with gates, fixed at the
entrances to the estate, all of which was enclosed with railings.
The splendid residences denominated Stanley Villas, Wilton
Parade, Imperial Terrace, and Lansdowne Crescent were not
dilatory in rearing their several heads in a locality so congenial to
their aristocratic proclivities, the foundations of the last being
prepared in 1864.</p>

<p>In 1864 the Lane Ends Hotel was levelled to the ground, and
the present handsome structure, in the Italian style of architecture,
raised on the site, being re-opened again two years later. The
foundation stone of the United Methodist Free Church was
laid in Adelaide Street on the 30th of March, in the year specified,
by James Sidebottom, esq., of Manchester, service being held in
the building in the course of a few months; whilst the newly-arrived
lifeboat was launched, and the first supply of the Fylde
Waterworks Company passed through their pipes to Blackpool
on the 20th of July. The station of the lifeboat, named the
“Robert William,” is situated near the beach at South Shore,
close to the Manchester Hotel; and here we may mention that
this boat, under the skilful and intrepid management of its crew
and coxswain, has been instrumental on several occasions in
affording aid in time of shipwreck. Amongst these instances may
be noted the rescue of a crew of fourteen persons belonging to
the barque “Susan L. Campbell,” wrecked on Salthouse Bank on
the 11th April, 1867, assistance being rendered also to the barque
“A. L. Routh”; and the rescue of the crew of the schooner
“Glyde,” stranded on the South Beach on the same eventful
morning. The annual expense incurred in the support of this
valuable institution is defrayed by voluntary contributions.</p>

<p>The unflagging efforts of the inhabitants to promote the comfort<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346"></a>[346]</span>
of their visitors in matters of household convenience and accommodation,
and to render their sojourns by the shore productive of
pleasurable, as well as healthful, sensations, were manifestly well
appreciated by those for whose benefit they were intended. The
daily crowds parading the recently-erected pier were satisfactory
evidence of the high estimation in which that elegant addition to
the attractions of the place was held, whilst the thronged
thoroughfares during the heat of summer bore witness to the
growing affection which Blackpool was gaining for itself in the
hearts of the million. Active exertions were necessary on the part
of the builders to keep pace with the ever-increasing demand for
more extended residential provision, houses being scarcely completed
before the eager tenants had established themselves in their
new domiciles. The greater portion of the Clifton Arms Hotel
was pulled down in the autumn of 1865, and rebuilt on an
enlarged and improved scale, being finished and ready for occupation
in the ensuing spring. On the 20th of June, 1865, the
first members of the Blackpool Volunteer Artillery Corps,
amounting to about 60 men, took the oath customary on enrolment,
and at the same meeting appointed their officers. Ten
years later a commodious drill-shed was erected for their use.</p>

<p>In 1866 the temporary iron church, to which allusion has been
made in a late page, was superseded by the existing substantial
one in Queen Street, bearing the name of its predecessor. The
edifice was opened for divine service on Thursday, the 3rd of
May, by the Rev. E. B. Chalmers, M.A., of Salford, but was not
consecrated until 1870. The architecture is an early and simple
style of decorated Gothic, with thick walls and prominently projecting
buttresses. The east and west ends are lighted respectively
by four and five-light traceried windows and lancets. The steeple,
which is well buttressed, has in its upper stage a belfry for six
bells, and is surmounted by a vane. Until recent additions were
made, the church contained sittings for 1,000 persons. The
building originally comprised a broad nave, with a central aisle
and two side passages giving access to the seats, all of which were
open benches with sloping backs; north and south transepts
with galleries, lighted by bay windows; a spacious chancel, with
north and south aisles, the former being fitted up as a vestry, and
the latter used as the organ-chamber; a spacious porch at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347"></a>[347]</span>
west end, with a wide double door; a west gallery extending over
the porch, and approached by a staircase along the basement of
the tower; and a baptistry covered with a separate hipped roof.
The alterations just alluded to were carried out in 1874, and consisted
of the erection of north and south aisles to the nave,
providing accommodation for about 300 more worshippers. The
district assigned to Christ Church in 1872 was converted into a
parish in 1874, and the title of vicar given to the incumbent.
The Rev. C. H. Wainwright, M.A., to whose exertions the new
structure mainly owes its existence, was the first incumbent, and
is the present vicar. The schools connected with the church are
situated in Queen Street, and were built in 1872.</p>

<p>During the year 1866 the Lancaster Banking Company and the
Manchester and County Banking Company each opened a branch
in Blackpool, and like the Preston Bank, previously referred to,
now transact business daily.</p>

<p>In July, 1867, the Prince of Wales Arcade on Central Beach
was finished and opened, comprising a block of building, with
extensive market accommodation, assembly rooms, etc., erected
on the site between the Beach and Royal Hotels in an imposing
and ornamental style of architecture; and on the 19th of
December, the corner stone of the Temperance Hall in Coronation
Street was laid by the Rev. R. Crook, and in the following July the
erection was completed and opened. The temperance movement
had been commenced in Blackpool four years anterior to that
date, when a Band of Hope in connection with the United
Methodist Free Church was formed, and the number of its
members increased so rapidly in the intervening time that it was
considered advisable to build the present Hall for their meetings,
and for those of others who were interested in the same cause.</p>

<p>The marked success which had attended the construction of
the North Pier induced a company of gentlemen to erect a similar
one, running seaward from the margin of the promenade at the
south of Blackpool. The first pile was screwed in July, 1867,
and on the 30th of May, 1868, the South Pier and Jetty were
thrown open to the public without any inaugural ceremony. It
is built of wrought iron and timber, and has the following
dimensions:—Total length 1,518 feet, the main promenade being
1,118 feet, and the lower promenade or jetty 400 feet; the entrance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348"></a>[348]</span>
is on an abutment 60 feet wide, where there are gates, toll-houses,
waiting and retiring-rooms; the pier head is rectangular in form,
and composed of strong timber, containing an area of 8,120 superficial
feet. The chief promenade is furnished with seats on each
side throughout its whole length, together with twelve recesses,
on which are shops for the sale of fancy articles and refreshments.
On the head of the pier are placed two large waiting and refreshment
rooms, as well as a commodious shelter and wind guard.
At the extremity of the jetty is a beacon and light as required by
the authorities at Trinity House.</p>

<p>In 1868 a magnificent pile of buildings, erected in Talbot
Square, and called the Arcade and Assembly Rooms, was completed.
This structure contains a basement and arcade of very
elegant shops, a restaurant, refreshment and billiard rooms,
together with a handsome and spacious saloon, surrounded within
by a gallery, and furnished with a neat stage for theatrical representations
and other entertainments. Several sleeping apartments
were added in 1874, and a certain section of the edifice arranged
as a private hotel.</p>

<p>The promenade had always been esteemed so much the property
of the house and land owners on the front of the beach that to
them was delegated the onerous duty of maintaining in repair such
portions of the hulking as ran before each of their possessions,
the walk itself being kept in order and supported by subscriptions
amongst the visitors and residents generally. Under this arrangement
although the embankment was ensured from being carried
away by the waves, there was no certainty that its upper surface
would invariably present that neat and finished appearance so necessary
to the success of a marine promenade. Voluntary contributions
are in most instances but a precarious support on which to rely
exclusively, and at Blackpool their unfortunate characteristic was
prominently exemplified, more particularly during the earlier years
of the watering-place, when visitors, whom the summer had drawn
to the coast, too frequently discovered their favourite lounge in a
state far from attractive to the pedestrian. Recently there had
been comparatively little cause for complaint as to the condition
in which each opening season found the promenade, but it was
felt on all sides that the day had arrived when a new and much
more extensive walk should be laid out, and that the responsibility<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349"></a>[349]</span>
of maintaining both it and the fence in proper order
should devolve upon the town, from the funds, or rather
borrowing powers, of which it was proposed to carry out the
undertaking. In 1865 a special act of parliament had been
obtained with this object by the Local Board of Health, at a cost
of £2,159, by which permission to borrow up to £30,000 was
granted, but no active steps were then taken, and three years later
a supplemental act was procured to borrow up to an amount
which, when added to the amount already in hand under the
former act, would not exceed altogether two years’ assessable
value, the whole to be repaid within a period of fifty years from
the date of receiving the loan. There were other difficulties to
encounter, notwithstanding that the Board had the power of
compulsory purchased granted, in the buying of land to prosecute
the purpose of the act. These were ultimately overcome by
arbitration in cases where disputes had arisen. A supplemental
act in 1867 allowed the board to amend and curtail several
clauses in the original act, the first of which was to abridge the
dimensions of the proposed work, the second to empower the
levying of rates according to the act of 1865 on the completion of
each section of the undertaking, and the third to extend the time
for the compulsory purchase of land from three to five years.
According to the act the commissioners gained a right to collect
tolls for the usage of the promenade from all persons not assessed
or liable to be assessed by any rate leviable by the Local Board of
Health, with the exception of those crossing to the piers. This
power, it may be stated, was not intended to be, and never has
been, put in force. The promenade proposed to be made would
reach from Carleton Terrace to the further end of South Shore, a
distance of about two miles; and the work was divided into three
sections, the first of which, begun in 1868, was let to Mr. Robert
Carlisle, contractor, for £16,043, and extended from South Shore
to the Fox Hall Hotel. The storm which occurred on January
31st, 1869, washed away 350 yards of the newly-constructed sea
fence and carriage-drive, with about 16,000 cubic yards of embankment,
and about 6,000 square yards of pitching. Another storm
which took place on the 28th of February, added considerably to
the damage just stated, by tearing down a length of 250 yards,
which was entirely completed, so that the total injury inflicted by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350"></a>[350]</span>
the waves during the gale represented 600 lineal yards of sea fence,
carriage-drive, and promenade, comprising 21,000 cubic yards of
embankment, all of which had to be replaced from the shore at
a considerable expense, in addition to 9,500 square yards of
pitching, etc., connected therewith. No. 2 section, running from
the Fox Hall Hotel to the New Inn, was contracted for by a
Manchester gentleman at £3,964, but in consequence of his not
being able to carry out the work, it was re-let, and Mr.
Chatburn succeeded him on the increased terms of £4,942. No.
3 section, stretching from the New Inn to the southern extremity
of Carleton Terrace, was also constructed by Mr. Robert Carlisle,
at a cost of £10,356. The whole of the ironwork was supplied
by Mr. Clayton, of Preston, and necessitated an expenditure of
£3,275. The sea fence consists of a sloping breastwork, pitched
with stones on a thick bed of clay puddle, the interstices between
the stones having been filled in with asphalt or cement concrete.
The slope is curvilinear, and one in four on an average. Next to
the breast is the promenade and carriage-drive. The promenade
is seven yards wide, and has an even surface of asphalting, being
separated from the carriage-drive by a line of side stones. In order
to obtain space between the houses and the sea for the promenade
and carriage-drive, a part of the shore was regained by an embankment
along South Shore, and along the northern district by an
iron viaduct, which projects considerably over the sea fence, and
encircles the marine aspect of Bailey’s Hotel. The floor of the
viaduct is formed with patent buckled plates, filled in with
concrete, and finished with asphalt. The plates are fixed to rolled
joists, and supported on neat cast-iron columns, screwed down
into the solid. The west front of the promenade is guarded by
an iron railing, and furnished at intervals with seats of the same
material, situated on the embankment to the south, and on projecting
ledges of the viaduct along the northern length. The
carriage-drive, twelve yards wide, runs parallel with the
promenade throughout the entire extent, and is formed of
shingle, clay, and macadam. It has a footway along the
frontages of the adjoining property, the whole being well drained
and lighted with gas. The complete structure was finished and
formally opened to the public on Easter Monday, 18th of April,
1870, by Colonel Wilson-Patten, M.P., the present Lord Winmarleigh.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351"></a>[351]</span>
The town was profusely decorated with bunting of
every hue; triumphal arches of evergreens and ensigns spanned
many of the thoroughfares, notably Talbot Road and along the
front; whilst an immense procession, consisting of the Artillery
Volunteers, Yeomanry in uniform, trades with their emblems,
friendly societies, schools, etc., headed by a band, and comprising
in its ranks no less than twelve mayors from important towns of
Lancashire, conducted Colonel Wilson-Patten to that portion
of the promenade opposite Talbot Square, where the ceremony of
declaring the walk accessible for public traffic was gone through.
During the evening the watering-place was illuminated, and the
eventful day closed with a large ball, held in honour of the
occasion.</p>

<p>The wisdom of the authorities in having Blackpool provided
with a marine promenade and a frontage unrivalled by any on the
coasts of England was soon evinced by the increase in the stream
of visitors poured into the place during the summer months.
Fresh houses for their accommodation were being rapidly erected
in many parts of the town, and everywhere there were ample
evidences that prosperity was dealing liberally with the town.
The wooden railings, which heretofore had been deemed sufficiently
ornamental fences for the residences facing the sea, were
removed, and elegant iron ones substituted, apportioning to each
habitation its own plot of sward or garden. The proprietor of
Bailey’s Hotel hastened to follow the example which had been set
by those who were interested in the Clifton Arms and Lane Ends
Hotels, and commenced a series of levellings and rebuildings,
under the superintendence and according to the designs of Messrs.
Speakman and Charlesworth, architects, of Manchester, which
extended over several years, and have now rendered the hotel one
of the most imposing and handsome edifices in the watering-place.
Further alterations, consisting in the erection of shops on a vacant
piece of land lying on the north side of the hotel, in the same
style of architecture, and continuous with it, were carried out in
1876.</p>

<p>In 1871 a project was launched for purchasing Raikes Hall
with the estate belonging thereto, situated on the east aspect of
Blackpool, and converting the latter into a park and pleasure
gardens. In that year a company was formed, entitled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352"></a>[352]</span>
the Raikes Hall Park, Gardens, and Aquarium Company,
and the land obtained without delay. Vigorous operations
were at once commenced to render the grounds of the old mansion
suitable for the purposes held in view, whilst the building
itself speedily underwent sundry alterations and additions
in its transformation into a refreshment house on a large
scale. A spacious terrace, walks, promenades, and flower beds
were laid out, and an extensive conservatory constructed with all
haste, and in the summer after gaining possession of the estate,
the works had so far progressed that the public were admitted at
a small charge per head. Since that date a dancing platform has
been put down, an immense pavillion erected, and many other
changes effected in the wide enclosure. Pyrotechnic displays,
acrobatic performances, etc., are held in the gardens, which comprise
about 40 statute acres, during the season, whilst agricultural
shows and other meetings occasionally take place within its
boundaries. An extensive lake was formed in 1875, and an
excellent race-course marked out. Raikes Hall has a brief history
of its own, and was erected about the middle of the eighteenth
century by a Mr. Butcher, who resided there. Tradition affirms
that this gentleman sprang suddenly into an ample fortune from
a station of obscurity and poverty, giving rise to a supposition
that he had appropriated to his own uses a large mass of wealth
asserted to have been lost at that time in a vessel wrecked on the
coast. It is probable, however, that the foregoing is merely an
idle tale, utterly unworthy of credence. Mr. Butcher, who was
succeeded by his son, died in 1769, at the ripe age of 80, and was
interred in Bispham churchyard, the following words being
inscribed on his tombstone:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“His pleasure was to give or lend,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He always stood a poor man’s friend.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The mansion and estate were purchased by William Hornby,
esq., of Kirkham, shortly before his death in 1824, and by him
bequeathed to his brother John Hornby, esq., of Blackburn, who
married Alice Kendall, a widow, and the daughter of Daniel
Backhouse, esq., of Liverpool. Daniel Hornby, esq., the eldest
son of that union, inherited the property on the decease of his
father in 1841, and took up his abode at the Hall until the early
part of 1860, when he left the neighbourhood. Raikes Hall then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353"></a>[353]</span>
became the seat of a Roman Catholic Convent School, which
continued in possession for several years, until the new and
handsome edifice standing on a rising ground in Little Layton
was erected and ready for its reception. Shortly after the
removal of the school the land and residence were purchased by
the company above named, and their aspects began to undergo
the changes already indicated. The census returns of the
township collected in 1871, furnished a total of 7,902 persons,
all of whom, with the exception of an insignificant proportion,
were resident in Blackpool.</p>

<p>In consequence of a letter from the Secretary of State, giving
notice that the burial ground in connection with St. John’s
Church must be closed after the 31st of December, 1871, the
responsibility of providing a suitable place for interments was
thrown upon the authorities, and the members of the Local
Board of Health formed themselves into a Burial Board, their
first meeting being held on the 20th of June in the year just
specified. A committee was appointed, and in the ensuing
August purchased for £1,759 an eligible site of 8½ acres,
lying by the side of the New Road, into which the entrance
gates of the cemetery now open. The plans for the requisite
erections were prepared by Messrs. Garlick, Park, and
Sykes, architects, of Preston, and the work of preparing the
ground commenced in October, the contract for the chapels and
lodge being let in December. As such a brief interval had to
elapse before the order for closing the churchyard would be put
in force, the Board applied, successfully, for permission to keep
it open six months longer. The cemetery, however, progressed
so tardily that it was necessary to renew the application on two
future occasions, and the churchyard continued in use until the
31st of May, 1873. Five acres of the land were laid out from
plans supplied by Mr. Gorst, surveyor to the board, and were
divided into nine sections, four of which were apportioned to the
Church of England, three to the Nonconformists, and two to the
Roman Catholics. The cemetery was enclosed from the highway
by stone palisadings and boundary walls, having massive iron
railings. The approach to the grounds is through a spacious
entrance, with a double iron gate in the centre, and a single gate
on either side, hung to stone pillars. Inside the gate is the lodge,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354"></a>[354]</span>
built of stone and comprising a residence for the keeper, offices,
etc. The mortuary chapels, which are all of stone, have an
elegant appearance, that of the Church of England being stationed
in the middle, with the Nonconformists’ and Roman Catholics’
edifices lying respectively west and east of it. The style of the
buildings is Gothic of the first pointed period. The roofs are
open-timbered, high-pitched, and covered with Welsh slates in
bands of different colours, being also crested with tiles. Entrance
to the chapels is gained by a porch, and there is a vestry attached
to each. The floors are laid with plain tiles of various tints.
Evergreens, shrubs, and forest trees have been planted on the
borders of the grounds, whilst the walks are wide and well cared
for. The Nonconformists were the first to take possession of their
portion, which was dedicated to its solemn uses by a service held
on the 7th of February, 1873, exactly one week after which an
interment took place, being the earliest not only in their land but
in the whole ground. On the 2nd of August in the same year
the Right Rev. Dr. Fraser, bishop of Manchester, consecrated the
division set apart for the Church of England, which had been
licensed for burials in the previous May. The Roman Catholics
deferred their ceremonial until the month of June, 1874, acting
under license during the interval.</p>

<p>On the 26th of August, 1872, the Blackpool Sea Water
Company was registered under the limited liability act, with a
capital of £10,000, in shares of £10 each, for the purpose of
supplying water from the deep, together with the requisite
appliances for conducting it to the houses and elsewhere, to the
inhabitants of Blackpool; and rather more than two years later
a main of pipes had been laid along the front from the Merchants’
College in South Shore as far as their steam pumping works in
Upper Braithwaite Street.</p>

<p>In 1874 the watering-place had developed so rapidly during
past years that the members of the Local Board of Health felt
that the powers appertaining to a body of that description were
no longer adequate to the proper government of the town, and a
public meeting to ascertain the opinion of the ratepayers on the
subject of incorporation was called on Tuesday, the 6th of
November, 1874. After considerable discussion, it was proposed
by the Rev. N. S. Jeffreys: “That a petition be drawn up and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_355"></a>[355]</span>
signed by the chairman on behalf of the meeting, praying that a
Charter of Incorporation be granted for the town of Blackpool,
and that the same be forwarded to the proper authorities; and
that the necessary steps be taken to obtain such Charter.” The
proposition was adopted without a dissentient; and at the
ensuing assembly of the Local Board of Health on Tuesday, the
10th of November, a similar motion was brought forward by
W. H. Cocker, esq., J.P., with an equally successful result. The
prayers were forwarded to the appropriate official quarters in
London, and on the 26th of May, 1875, Major Donnelly, R.E.,
the commissioner appointed by Her Majesty’s Privy Council,
attended at the Board-room to hold an inquiry as to whether the
importance and necessities of the place warranted a favourable
answer to the request. In the course of the examination, it was
stated, amongst other things, that the rateable value of the
proposed borough was in 1863, £17,489; 1866, £35,175; 1869,
£45,755; 1872, £55,653; 1874, £63,848; and in 1875, £73,035.
Also that the town contained three churches, seven chapels, three
rooms used for religious services, two markets under the Local
Board, other markets owned by private individuals, four public
sea-water baths, three banks, an aquarium, public gardens, etc.
On the 16th of the following July information was officially
conveyed to W. M. Charnley, esq., the law-clerk of the board,
that the lords of the Privy Council had determined to accede to
the prayer of the town, and that the borough should consist of
six wards, with one alderman and three councillors for each. A
draft of the scheme of incorporation was prepared by the law-clerk,
and forwarded to London. On the 22nd January, 1876,
the charter, having passed through the necessary forms, obtained
the royal assent, being received by W. M. Charnley, esq., two
days later. The document, after quoting several acts of parliament,
proceeds to “grant and declare that the inhabitants of the
town of Blackpool and their successors, shall be for ever hereafter
one body politic and corporate in deed, fact, and name, and that
the said body corporate shall be called the Mayor, Aldermen, and
Burgesses of the Borough of Blackpool, who shall have and
exercise all the acts, powers, authorities, immunities, and privileges
which are now held and exercised by the bodies corporate
of the several boroughs” similarly created. Further, the deed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356"></a>[356]</span>
“grants and declares that the said Mayor, Aldermen, and Burgesses
and their successors shall and may for ever hereafter use a
common seal to serve them in transacting their business, and also
have armorial bearings and devices, which shall be duly entered
and enrolled in the Herald’s College;” also shall they have power
“to purchase, take, and acquire such lands, tenements, and
heriditaments, whatsoever, situate, lying, and being within the
borough, as shall be necessary for the site of the buildings and
premises required for the official purposes of the corporation.”
The Council was ordained to consist of “a Mayor, six Aldermen,
and eighteen Councillors, to be respectively elected at such times
and places, and in such manner” as those of other boroughs
existing under the same acts, in common with which they “shall
have, exercise, and enjoy all the powers, immunities, and privileges,
and be subject to the same duties, penalties, liabilities, and
disqualifications” appertaining to such positions. The first
election of councillors was directed to be held on the eleventh
day of April, 1876, followed by another on the 1st of November,
at which latter date one-third part of the councillors should go
out of office each year, and the vacant seats be refilled as specified;
the councillors to retire in the November, 1876, being those who
had obtained the smallest number of votes, and in November, 1877,
those with the next smallest number of votes. The first aldermen
of the borough “shall be elected and assigned to their respective
wards on the 19th day of April, 1876, and the councillors immediately
afterwards shall appoint who shall be the aldermen to go
out of office upon the 9th day of November ensuing,” and in
subsequent years those so retiring to be aldermen who have
retained their seats for the longest period without re-election.
The first mayor of the borough “shall be elected from and out
of the aldermen and councillors of the said borough, on the 19th
day of April, 1876,” the earliest appointment of auditors and
assessors being made on the 19th day of the following month.
The subjoined extent and names of the wards are also taken from
the charter:—</p>

<p>The election of councillors took place at the date specified in
the charter, under the superintendence of Mr. William Porter,
of Fleetwood and Blackpool, who had been nominated by the
authorities of the town as returning officer. On the 19th of
April the gentlemen elected assembled in the old board-room and
appointed aldermen and a mayor from amongst themselves, the
vacancies thus created being supplied by another appeal to the
burgesses of those wards whose representatives had been elevated

<p>From the time when the subject of incorporation was first
beginning to dawn upon the inhabitants as something to which
the rapid extension and growing importance of their town was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359"></a>[359]</span>
tending with no tardy pace, up to the present year of 1876,
buildings have increased at a rate unparalleled in any former
period of Blackpool’s history. No longer solitary erections, or
even small groups, but whole streets have been added to the
expanding area of the place, consisting of handsome and spacious
edifices, of, indeed, notwithstanding their being situated to the rear,
exteriors which would, not many years ago, have been deemed
highly ornamental to the beach itself. In 1874 the south
section of the noble market-hall, on Hygiene Terrace, was being
arranged and fitted up with roomy tanks to form an aquarium on
a fairly large scale by W. H. Cocker, Esq., J.P., who had recently
acquired the proprietorship of the entire pile. The open space in
front of the building was fenced in, and furnished with three tanks
for seals, and other novel features to render it attractive and
pleasing. The walls of the interior were adorned with landscapes
in the spacious saloon, where the main tank, divided into
numerous compartments, each being supplied with a variety of
fish differing from its neighbours, occupies a central position.
Subsidiary tanks, filled with curious specimens of animated nature
from the “vasty deep,” stand in the entrance hall and recesses.
The aquarium was opened to the public on the 17th of May, in
the ensuing year.</p>

<p>On the 22nd of May, 1875, the foundation stone of a Primitive
Methodist chapel was laid in Chapel Street by Mr. J. Fairhurst,
of Wigan. Heretofore the members of that sect had met for
religious purposes in a mission room located in Foxhall Road.
The earliest service in the new chapel was conducted by the
resident minister, the Rev. E. Newsome, on Sunday, the 29th
of the following August. The Unitarians have a chapel in Bank
Street, which was formally opened by the Rev. J. R. Smith,
of Hyde, also in August, 1875. During the same month a
number of influential gentlemen purchased the estate of
Bank Hey from W. H. Cocker, esq., J.P., for £23,000, with the
intention of converting it into Winter Gardens. Possession was
gained, according to agreement, on the 1st of October. The
design of the company is to place on the land a concert room,
promenades, conservatories, and other accessories calculated to
convert the estate into a pleasant lounge, especially desirous
during inclement days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360"></a>[360]</span></p>

<p>Although South Shore is now intimately connected and
associated with Blackpool as one town, there was a period, and
not a very remote one, when it flourished as a separate and
distinct hamlet, widely divided from its more imposing neighbour.
The first house of South Shore was erected in 1819 by Mr.
Thomas Moore, who speedily added about ten more to the
solitary edifice. The growth of the village in earlier years was not
characterised by any great rapidity, and in 1830 the whole of the
buildings comprised no more than a thin row of respectable
cottages overlooking the sea, with a lawn or promenade in front.
In 1836 a church was built, partly by subscription and partly
from Queen Anne’s Bounty, and dedicated to the Holy Trinity.
Twenty-two years afterwards, owing to the development of South
Shore through the number of regular visitants who preferred the
quietude of its beach to the greater animation which prevailed
at Blackpool, the building was enlarged by the erection of
transepts and a new chancel, alterations which supplied further
sitting room for about 380 worshippers. The church is of brick,
and contains a handsome stained-glass east window, representing
the baptism of Christ by St. John the Baptist, another ornamental
window being inserted in the south wall. The mural tablets are
in memory of William Wilkinson, “who for twenty-five years was
an indefatigable teacher in the Sunday Schools of Marton and
South Shore,—he served his country in the battles of Talavera,
Busaco, Albuera, Vittoria, Pyrenees, Nive, Nivelle, and Toulouse,”
died 11th September, 1853, aged 66 years; and of James Metcalf,
“curate of South Shore, who departed this life July 24th, 1875,
aged 42 years, and was interred at the Parish Church of Bolton-le-Sands.”
The font is of grey stone, massive and carved. The
first organ obtained by the congregation was purchased in 1847.
In 1872 a tasteful lectern was forwarded to the church by the
Rev. J. B. Wakefield, to whom it had been presented by his
parishioners, as a token of esteem, about the close of his ministry
amongst them in 1870. The burial ground encircling the church
of Holy Trinity contains no monuments of special interest, if we
except a stone pedestal, surmounted by a broken column, erected
by public subscription to the memories of three fishermen,
drowned off Cross-slack, whilst following their avocation on the
11th of October, 1860.</p>

<p>There is now an ecclesiastical parochial district attached to the
church, of which the incumbent is the vicar.</p>

<p>On Thursday, the 24th of March, 1869, the corner stone of a
Wesleyan chapel in Rawcliffe Street, built at the sole expense of
Francis Parnell, esq., of South Shore, who subsequently added
the schools, was laid by Mrs. Parnell, wife of the donor. For
four or five years the members of this denomination had met on
the Sabbath in a small room in Bolton Street, originally designed
for a coach-house, and the necessity for more suitable and
extended accommodation through growing numbers had of late
pressed urgently upon the limited and not over wealthy assembly,
so that the generous offer of their townsman was gratefully
appreciated. The structure is in the Gothic style of architecture,
about fifty feet in length and forty feet in width, with brick
walls and stone facings, and will contain upwards of three
hundred persons. Service was first held in the new place of
worship, styled the Ebenezer Wesleyan Chapel, on Thursday, the
2nd of September, 1869, the officiating minister being the Rev.
W. H. Taylor, of Manchester. The room in Bolton Street was
subsequently converted into a Temperance Hall, and remained in
that capacity until the 30th of March, 1873, when it was appropriated
as a meeting-house by the Baptist sect. The progress of
South Shore has not until the last two or three years been
marked by that wonderful rapidity which has already been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362"></a>[362]</span>
noticed whilst delineating the prosperous career of Blackpool.
Nevertheless a steadily-increasing patronage was always extended
to the milder climate of the village under consideration, from its
earliest existence. Terraces of pretty and commodious residences
arose at intervals along the marine frontage, whilst elegant villas
have been erected both opposite the sea and nearer to the Lytham
Road. Building is at present (1876) being pushed forward with
great activity, houses springing up in endless succession along the
sides of thoroughfares but recently mapped out.</p>

<p class="dropcap">The township of Kirkham was probably the earliest
inhabited locality in the Fylde district; and although
it is impossible to assert that the very site of the
present town was a spot fixed upon by the Romans
for erecting their habitations, still as the road formed by those
people passed over it, and many remnants of their domestic
utensils, funereal urns, and other relics have been discovered in
the surrounding soil, there is strong presumptive evidence that
an ancient settlement was at least close at hand. Amongst the
traces of the old warriors disinterred in this neighbourhood may
be mentioned a large quantity of stones prepared for building
purposes, and numerous fragments of urns, ploughed up about
half a mile from Kirkham. The Mill Hill Field has also disclosed
frequent witnesses to the former presence of the Romans, notably
abundant specimens of their pottery and coinage, but perhaps the
greatest curiosity found in the vicinity is the boss or umbo of a
shield, wrought in brass, which was removed from a brook in the
field specified during the year 1792. In form the shield is somewhat
oval, having its central portion semi-globular, whilst the
outer rim is flat. The entire diameter is about eight inches, of
which the embossment supplies five. The horizontal and
encircling part is perforated in four separate places, apparently
for the passage of thongs or rivets. The highest surface of the
boss holds the representation of a human figure seated, with an
eagle to the left, the sides being adorned with an athlete<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364"></a>[364]</span>
respectively. Birds, swords, diminutive shields, etc., complete
the decorations.</p>

<p>From the year 418, when the Romans vacated the island, up
to the compilation of the Domesday Book by William the Conqueror
in 1080-86, a period of over six and a half centuries, history
preserves no record of any matter or event directly connected
with the town, as distinct from the Hundred in which it is
situated. Nevertheless it is obvious that Kirkham must have
sprung into being some time during that protracted era, insomuch
as it appears amongst the places existing in Amounderness in the
Norman survey just indicated. The name is a compound derived
from the Anglo-Saxons and Danes, and although the syllable
“Kirk,” coming from the latter, and signifying a church, could
not have been in use until those pirates first invaded the land in
787, and probably was not applied until the mistaken policy of
Alfred the Great allowed them to colonise this and other parts of
Northumbria, one hundred years later, still it would scarcely be
justifiable to conclude that there was no dwelling or village here,
as the Anglo-Saxon “ham” implies, anterior to that date. The
location of the place on the margin of an open thoroughfare, and
the former establishment of the Romans within or near to its
boundaries, incline us rather to the opinion that from the earliest
arrival of the Anglo-Saxons they had selected this site for the
foundation of a small settlement, and that the “ham” or hamlet
so created bore a purely Saxon title until the advent of the Danes,
under whose influence the orthography became altered by the
substitution from their vocabulary of the word “kirk” for the one
originally bestowed upon it.</p>

<p>Some idea of the condition of Kirkham at the Norman Conquest
may be gleaned from the report concerning the Fylde in
the Domesday Book, in which it is stated that of the 840 statute
acres comprised in the township, only 400 (four carucates) were
under cultivation, the rest being waste, that is, untilled, but very
possibly in service as forage ground for swine. At that period
the town undoubtedly possessed a church, one of the three mentioned
in the record above-named, as standing in Amounderness,
but the era of its erection is conjectural merely. The name of
Kirkham, however,—the church hamlet,—is manifestly of
ecclesiastical origin, and the Danish derivation of “kirk”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_365"></a>[365]</span>
implies that some religious building existed there, very likely
about the year 900, when that nation colonised the district, but
that a sacred edifice of some description had been constructed
long before may be deduced from the fact that Christianity had
been pretty generally embraced by the Anglo-Saxons dwelling in
this locality about the middle of the seventh century.</p>

<p>From the commencement of the Norman dominion the history
of Kirkham rises out of the mist which has obscured its earlier
ages, and we are enabled from the disclosures of ancient
documents, to follow out its career in a more satisfactory manner.
The church and tithes of Kirkham were presented amongst other
possessions, as a portion of the Hundred of Amounderness, by
William the Conqueror to the baron Roger de Poictou, and were
conferred by that nobleman about the year 1100, on the priory of
St. Mary’s, Lancaster,<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>—a monastic institution founded by him
from the Abbey of Sees in Normandy. This priory retained
possession of the church for only a few years, when it reverted to
its former owner, and was bestowed by him on the convent of
Shrewsbury, as shown by the charter of William, archbishop of
York, as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The monks of Salop in the day of my ancestors were often making complaints
that their church was unjustly robbed of the church of Kirckaham, because it had
been legally bestowed upon it by Roger, count of Poictou, and confirmed by
Thomas, archbishop, by authority of grants under seal. At length they have come
before us to state their complaints; and we, thus constrained and by the command
of lord Henry, legate of the apostolical see, committed their cause to be laid before
the synod of York.”</p>

</div>

<p>The archbishop Thomas here mentioned died either in 1100 or
1113, whilst William, the writer of the charter, died in 1154.
The York tribunal decided, after seeing the writings touching
the confirmation of the grant of the church of Kirkham to the
Shrewsbury convent, which the monks of Salop had sealed with
the seal of Thomas, the archbishop, that “the aforesaid church
should be restored to the church of Peter of Salop.”</p>

<p>In 1195 “a great controversy arose between Theobald Walter, on
the one part, and the abbot of Shrewsbury, on the other, concerning
the right of patronage of the church, which was thus settled: a
certain fine was levied in the king’s court that the abbot and his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_366"></a>[366]</span>
successors should receive from the church of Kirkham a pension
of twelve marks a year, and Theobald himself should for ever
remain the true Patron of the said church.”<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p>After the death of Theobald Walter, king John, who had the
guardianship of that nobleman’s heir, gave two parts of the church
to Simon Blund,<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> and later, in 1213, he bestowed the church upon
W. Gray, chancellor, for life.<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> Edward I. conferred the advowson
of the church of Kirkham upon the abbey of Vale Royal, a
monastic house founded by him in Cheshire; but the grant was
not made without strenuous opposition on the part of Sir
Theobald Walter or le Botiler,<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> a descendant of the Theobald
specified above, who maintained that the king had no legal
right to the advowson, which belonged to him as heir-at-law and
descendant of Theobald Walter, the first. A council assembled
to investigate the rival claims, and Edward, having asserted that
his father, Henry III., had granted the advowson to his clerk by
right of his crown, and not through any temporary power he
had as guardian of Theobald Walter’s heir, a statement which
Le Botiler’s attorney either could not or would not gainsay, the
advowson was adjudged to him, and Sir Theobald lay under
mercy.<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> This dispute probably occurred in the 8th year of
Edward’s sovereignty, 1280, for we find from the Rot. Chart. that
at that date the advowson was granted by the monarch to the
abbey of Vale Royal.</p>

<p>In 1286 Sir Otto de Grandison, who was ambassador at the
apostolic see, obtained a bull from the pope, Honorius IV., by
which the advowson of Kirkham was conferred upon the abbey
of Vale Royal for ever,<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> and on the 27th of January in the ensuing
year, Edward I. confirmed his former grant.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>In the fifty-fourth year of the reign of Henry III., 1269, power
was granted by royal charter to the manorial lord of Kirkham to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_367"></a>[367]</span>
hold a market and fair,<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> and as such privileges were allowed at
that time to only a few other towns in the whole county of
Lancashire, we must conclude that even at such an early date
Kirkham possessed some special advantages or interest to be able
so successfully to press its claims to this signal favour. That such
important powers as the holding of markets and fairs were not
allowed to be exercised without due and proper authority
is proved by a warrant which was issued twenty-three years
later, in the reign of Edward I., against the abbot of Vale
Royal, to which convent the manor of Kirkham belonged, to
appear before a judicial court to show by what authority he held
those periodical assemblies of the inhabitants. He pleaded that
the right had been first conceded to his predecessors by Henry III.,
and that subsequently the grant had been confirmed by the
present monarch, Edward I., in the fifteenth year of his dominion.
These assertions having been verified, the abbot was exculpated
from all blame, and orders were issued to the justices itinerant in
this county to the effect that they were in no way to interfere
with the exercise of those privileges, which were to be continued
exactly as they had been heretofore.<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> From a copy of a document<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>
framed four years later, in 1296, in which the whole of these rights
are embodied amongst other interesting matters, we learn that the
manor of Kirkham was granted to the abbot and convent of Vale
Royal in <i>frank-al-moigne</i>, that is, a tenure by which a religious
corporation holds lands for themselves and their successors for ever,
on condition of praying for the soul of the donor; that power was
given or confirmed to hold a fair of five days duration at the
Nativity of St. John the Baptist; that the borough of Kirkham,
which had been incorporated by the name of the burgesses of
Kirkham in the year 1282, the tenth of the reign of Edward I.,
was to be a free borough; that the burgesses and their heirs were
to have a free guild, with all the liberties which belonged to a free
borough; that there was to be in the borough a pillory, a prison,
and a ducking stool, and other instruments for the punishment of
evil doers; and that there were to be assizes of bread and ale,
and weights and measures. Continuing the perusal of this
document we find that the abbot of Vale Royal consented that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_368"></a>[368]</span>
the burgesses should elect two bailiffs from amongst themselves
annually, and that these should be presented and sworn; on the
other hand, however, the convent reserved to itself the perquisites
arising from the courts, stallage, assizes of bread and ale, etc., and
annual rents due at the period of festival legally appointed as
above. The names of the following gentlemen are appended to
the deed as witnesses:—Radulphus de Mouroyd, William le
Botyler, Robert de Holonde, Henry de Kytheleye, John Venyal,
William de Clifton, Thomas Travers, and others.</p>

<p>In 1327 an edict was published by the dean of Amounderness
in the church of Kirkham on behalf of the archbishop of York,
which commanded that the abbot or some one connected with the
convent of Vale Royal, should appear before that prelate at the
cathedral of his see on “the third lawful day after the Sunday on
which is sung <i>Quasi modo genite vira et munimenta</i>,”<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> to show by
what right and authority the Cheshire convent held the church
just mentioned. In answer to this summons a monk, named
Walter Wallensis, from Vale Royal, appeared before the archbishop
on the day named, in 1328, and produced in proof of
the title of his monastery to the church, the charter of Edward
I., the bull of the pope, and letters from several archdeacons,
recognising the proprietorship of the convent. In addition he
brought four witnesses, viz., William de Cotton, advocate in the
court of York, who stated that for eighteen years the abbot and
convent of Vale Royal had supplied the rectors to the church of
Kirkham; John de Bradkirk, who said that he had known the
church for forty years as a parishioner, and had on many occasions
seen the charter confirming the grant of the advowson, etc., to
Vale Royal, as for fifteen years he had been in the service of that
monastery, and at the time when the present archbishop of York
farmed the church of Kirkham, twelve years ago, from the
convent of Vale Royal, had been the bearer of the money raised
from this church to that dignitary at York; Robert de Staneford,
of Kirkham, who gave similar evidence, and bore witness to the
existence of the charter of Edward I., which he had seen; and
Robert de Blundeston, of Vale Royal, who gave evidence as to the
genuineness of the documents produced having been admitted by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_369"></a>[369]</span>
Roger de Nasynton, public notary, etc. The result of these
attestations was that the case was dismissed against the abbot of
Vale Royal, and his right to the church of Kirkham, with all its
chapels, fruits, rents, etc, allowed to have been fully proved.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p>In 1334 a mandamus was issued by Edward III., at York, to
Robert Foucher, the sheriff of Lancashire, stating that, contrary
to a charter of Edward I., which prohibited the sheriffs from
making distraints on the rectors of churches or on estates with
which the churches had been endowed, he had “under pretext of
his office lately entered into the lands and tenements near Kirkham,
which are of the endowment of that church, and had
heavily distrained the abbot of Vale Royal, parson of that
church”; and ordering the said sheriff to abandon the claim, and
to make restitution of anything he might thus have illegally
obtained, and “by no means to attempt to make any distraint in
the lands and tenements which are of the endowment of the
aforesaid church,” at any future time.<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>Somewhere about the year 1332 a monk, named Adam de
Clebury, who held the temporalities of Shrewsbury Abbey, sued
Peter, the abbot of Vale Royal, for five hundred marks, which he
declared were the accumulated arrears of twelve marks, ordered to
be paid annually by Theobald Walter, to the former monastery,
out of the funds of the church of Kirkham, according to the
issue of a trial in the king’s court, between Theobald and the
convent of Shrewsbury, respecting the advowson, etc., of that
church in 1195. Peter is said, in the Harleian manuscript, from
which this account is taken, to have “redeemed that writ and
many others from the sheriff of Lancashire,” from which it may
be understood that he had paid the sum demanded, or in some
conciliatory way settled the case during his lifetime, for we hear
no more of the matter until shortly after his death in 1342, when
an action to enforce a similar payment was brought against his
successor, Robert de Cheyneston. This ecclesiastic, however, is
said to “have manfully opposed the abbot of Shrewsbury,” and
to have journied up to London to hold an interview with him on
the subject, at which, after “many allegations on each side, he
gave to the abbot of Shrewsbury £100 to pay his labours and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_370"></a>[370]</span>
expenses,” and in that manner the dispute was brought to a
termination about the year 1343.</p>

<p>In 1337 Sir William de Clifton, of Westby, made an offer to
the abbot of Vale Royal to purchase certain tithes from him for
twenty marks, and on the ecclesiastic refusing to entertain this
proposition, the indignant knight became most unruly and
outrageous in his conduct, as shown by the following charge
which was that year preferred against him by the abbot, who
stated:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That he had thrust with a lance at a brother of the monastery in the presence
of the abbot and convent; that he had retained twenty marks which he was
pledged and bound to pay to the abbot, in order to weary him with expenses and
labours; that it was the custom, from time immemorial, for the parishioners of
Kirkham to convey their tithe-corn to their barns, and there keep it until the
ministers of the rector came for it; but that he (Sir William Clifton), in contempt
of the church, had allowed his tithes and those of his tenants to waste and rot in
the fields, and very often by force and arms had driven away the tithe-collectors;
he also had compelled a cart of the rector, laden with hay, to remain on his land
for upwards of a month, and in derision had made the rector’s mare into a hunting
palfrey; he also had neglected to keep the tithes of his calves, pigeons, orchards,
huntings, and hawkings, and would not allow the procurator, under threat of
death, to enter his estate, but he and his satellites had irreverently burst into the
sanctuary of God, where they had assailed the priests and clerks, and impeded
them in the discharge of their duties. Moreover the aforesaid knight would not
permit any of his tenants who were living in flagrant sin, to be corrected or
punished by the ordinaries.”<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>In concluding the above list of misdemeanours, the abbot complained
that Sir William had ordered a severe flagellation “even
to the effusion of blood,” to be inflicted on Thomas, the clerk, in
the town of Preston, and that this scourging had taken place as
directed, in the presence of the under-mentioned gentlemen, who
seemed to have been well pleased with the vigorous measures
adopted by the knight, and to have rendered him willing assistance
when called upon:—</p>

<p>This charge was laid before the lord abbot of Westminster by
the abbot of Vale Royal, and the former, after hearing the statement
of offences, commanded that Sir William de Clifton and others
enumerated therein, should appear before him to answer for their
misdeeds; but as neither Sir William nor any of his friends and
abettors took the least notice of the summons, it was decided that
an endeavour should be made to arrange the quarrel by arbitration.
To this the knight seems to have been favourable, and nominated
William Laurence, John de Crofton, and Robert Mareys to act
as his arbitrators; whilst those of the abbot were William
Baldreston, rector of St. Michael’s-on-Wyre; Robert Baldreston,
his brother, and a rector also; and Richard de Ewyas, a monk
of Deulacres. The decision of the court thus constituted was that
Sir William de Clifton should acknowledge his guilt, and ask
pardon and absolution for the same from the abbot, unto whose
will and grace he should submit himself; in addition the knight
was ordered to pay a fine of twenty marks, and make good to
the abbot the tithes which he had destroyed or refused to pay.
Sir William accepted the verdict, and bound himself to fulfil its
conditions by oath; the rest were required to enter into a promise
to abstain in future from making any attempt to injure the church
of Kirkham, or anything connected with it, and to provide a large
wax candle, which was paraded round that church on the feast
of palms, and afterwards presented as a peace-offering to St.
Michael.<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p>In 1357 Cardinal John Thoresby, archbishop of York, made a
new ordination of the vicarage of Kirkham, by which it was
decreed that, instead of the secular vicar appointed aforetime, the
abbot and convent of Vale Royal should select some one from
their own monastery to fill the office whenever a vacancy occurred.
By this fresh regulation the abbot and convent of Vale Royal were
bound to pay to the vicar forty marks per annum, and he on his
part was pledged to keep the parsonage house in proper repair and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_372"></a>[372]</span>
perform all ecclesiastical duties. Three years afterwards a vicar of
Kirkham was charged and convicted of having been guilty of
maladministration in his position as dean of Amounderness, but
subsequently he received a full pardon from King Edward III.</p>

<p>In the year 1401, during the reign of Henry IV., the right to
hold a market and fair was again confirmed to the abbot and
convent of Vale Royal; subjoined is a translated copy of the
grant, which bore the date of the 2nd of July:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The king to all men greeting: We have inspected a charter made by our
progenitor, Lord Edward, formerly king of England, in these words:—‘Edward,
by the grace of God king of England, lord of Ireland, and duke of Aquitaine, to
the archbishops, bishops, abbots, priors, earls, barons, justices, sheriffs, provosts,
ministers, and to all his bailiffs and subjects, health. Know that we have granted
and by this our present charter confirm to our beloved in Christ the Abbot and
Convent of Vale Royal, that they and their successors for ever shall have a market
in each week on Thursday at their manor at Kirkham in the county of Lancaster,
and also in each year a fair at the same town of five days duration, that is on the
vigil, on the Day, and on the morrow of the Nativity of St. John the Baptist, and
on the two days succeeding; unless the market and fair be found injurious to
neighbouring markets and fairs. Therefore we desire and firmly enjoin, both for
ourselves and our heirs, that the aforesaid Abbot and Convent and their successors
for ever shall have the aforesaid market and fair at the aforesaid manor with all
the liberties and free customs appertaining to similar institutions, unless such
market and fair be detrimental to neighbouring interests as aforesaid.</p>

<p>“‘These being witnesses:—The venerable fathers Robert Bath and Wells, John
Winchester, and Anthony Durham, bishops; William de Valence, our uncle;
Henry de Lacy, earl of Lincoln; master Henry de Newark, archdeacon of
Richmond; master William de Luda, archdeacon of Durham; master William de
Cornere, dean of Wymburne; John de St. John; William de Latymer; and others.</p>

<p>“‘Given under our hand at Bourdeaux on the 21st of January, in the 15th year
of our reign.’</p>

<p>“Holding the aforesaid charter and all matters contained in it as authentic and
acceptable both for ourselves and our heirs, as far as our power extends, we accept,
approve, grant, and confirm to our beloved in Christ, the present Abbot and
Convent of the aforesaid place and their successors that the aforesaid charter be
considered just, also we affirm that the same Abbot and Convent and their
predecessors legally had and held the said market and fair before this date.</p>

<p>“In testimony thereof, etc. Witness the king at Westminster on the 2nd of
July.”<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

</div>

<p>At the dissolution of monasteries the manor of Kirkham,
together with the advowson of the church, was transferred by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_373"></a>[373]</span>
Henry VIII. from the abbot and convent of Vale Royal to the
dean and chapter of Christ Church, Oxford.</p>

<p>In 1560 Queen Elizabeth ratified and confirmed by letters
patent all former charters concerning Kirkham by a deed bearing
the date of July 2nd; and later, in 1619, the 17th year of the
reign of James I., a record of the Duchy Court of Lancaster states
that the bailiffs and burgesses of Kirkham presented a petition
praying that they might elect into their government some men
of account dwelling near the town, and that it might be declared
that the bailiffs had lawful power and authority to correct
all malefactors and offenders according to the laws and liberties of
the town, and to do and perform all other duties appertaining to
their office. They prefaced their prayer by asserting that “the
town of Kirkham had been used as an ancient market town and
that the inhabitants thereof had time out of mind been accounted
a Corporation, incorporated by the name of Bailiffs and Burgesses,
and that of late owing to some of the bailiffs being but simple and
weak men, and the inhabitants but poor and numerous, it had been
found impossible to govern in a proper and satisfactory manner
the large confluences of people at fair and market seasons,” for
which reason they were desirous of gaining an extension of their
existing powers as set forth in the plea. The court decreed that
“the then Bailiffs of Kirkham and the Burgesses of the same, and
their successors, for ever, should and might from thenceforth have
and enjoy their ancient usages and liberties by the name of the
Bailiffs and Burgesses of the Town of Kirkham, and that the
Bailiffs should yearly be chosen out of the Burgesses according
to the said usages, or as they in their discretion should think meet,
for the better government of the said Town and the people thereunto
resorting, also that the Bailiffs, Burgesses, and Inhabitants
should be guildable, and have in the said Town a prison, etc., as
had been heretofore, and that the Dean and Chapter and
their successors, farmers, and tenants, should and might from
henceforth have all their fairs, markets, liberties, privileges,
jurisdictions, Court Leets, Court Barons, Courts of Pleas, and the
Fair Court, as heretofore had been.” The foregoing was ordered
to be read in the parish church on the ensuing sabbath, and also
in the market place.</p>

<p>From the following ancient and somewhat lengthy document<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_374"></a>[374]</span>
or lease, much interesting matter may be gleaned, and for that
reason it was deemed better to give it unabridged:—</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_376"></a>[376]</span></p>

<p>There is an old deed in the bailiffs’ chest, bearing the date 1725,
and evidently a summary of charters, powers, etc., drawn up in
order to be submitted to the inspection of some legal authority,
whose opinions on different points are appended, from which it
appears that from the earliest incorporation of the town it had
been governed by two bailiffs and twelve burgesses in common
council assembled, who were annually chosen within the borough,
and that they “usually assessed such persons, not being free
burgesses in the same borough, as had come into and exercised
trades within the borough (whether they had served apprenticeships
to such trades or not), in and with such reasonable annual
payments to the Corporation as the bailiffs and burgesses thought
fit”; persons born in the borough were treated in a similar
manner. The bailiffs inflicted penalties on all breakers of the
peace, the amount of fine imposed being regulated according
to the condition of the offender, thus an esquire was mulcted
in 40s., a gentleman 10s., and anyone of an inferior grade 5s.
Profane cursing and swearing also came under their jurisdiction.
The collection of freedom money from traders commencing
business in Kirkham was a somewhat questionable act on the
part of the local rulers, and indeed they themselves were
evidently troubled with doubts as to their right to levy the tax,
for the muniment chest contains several opinions of eminent
counsel as to the validity of such a course. In 1738 a person
named William Marsden started as a tanner in Kirkham, and
obstinately refused to purchase his freedom or close his premises,
but, at the end of twelve months, the assembled bailiffs and
burgesses instructed and authorised the town or borough serjeant
to collect and levy the sum of two shillings and sixpence upon
the goods and chattels of William Marsden, by distress and sale.
This impost was abolished during the latter half of the eighteenth
century. The bailiffs formed part of the Court Leet held annually
in the seventeenth century and were elected from amongst the
jurors. Subjoined are a few extracts from the minute book of the
“Court leet of frank pledge of yᵉ foundation of Henry VIII.,” as it

and ran as under:—</p>

<p class="center">“To the Inhabitants of the Burrough of Kirkham.</p>

<p>“You are hereby required forthwith to cleanse the Streets over against your
Dwelling Houses, Outhouses, and all other Buildings, together with all Frontsteads
whatsoever, on Penalty of Sixpence for each default.</p>

<p>“You have also hereby notice to remove all the Dung-hills out of the Streets in
a month’s time or otherwise they will be removed for the use of the Burrough.</p>

<p>“Likewise all the Rubbish out of the Streets on such Penalties as the Bayliffs
and Common Council shall think fit to inflict. Given under our Common Seal of
the Towne this first Day of December, 1728.”</p>

</div>

<p>At a later period the burgesses neglected to choose and appoint
bailiffs for many years, or to use their privileges; and apprehensive
at length that such remissions were tantamount to a forfeiture of
their charter by their own act, they determined to take legal
advice as to the most expeditious way to resume their powers.
It was given as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If any of those acting Burgesses are alive I would advise them to assemble at
their former Gild or usual Place of meeting, and then and there choose other
Burgesses, after which they may elect from among them Two Bailiffs and make
an entry of such choice in one of the Old Books, and then proceed as formerly to
act in their corporate capacity; and let their first Punishment be inflicted on some
person unlikely to dispute their authority, for instance a woman drunkard may be
set in the stocks.</p>

<p>“Having done as above directed they may for the better Government of the
town make some Byelaws, and enter them ffair into a Book to be kept for that
purpose, but let none of these new Laws be put in Execution till they are confirmed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_379"></a>[379]</span>
by the Chancelour, and that will be some foundation ffor a petition to that
Court.</p>

<p>“But if all the Burgesses are dead I can see no Remedy whatsoever but by
obtaining a new Charter, which will be very Difficult if not Impracticable.”</p>

</div>

<p>A statement as to manorial extent of Kirkham at the latter
part of the seventeenth century is preserved amongst the records
of a court, further reference to which will be made anon, and
reads as here given:—“The lands lying within the manor of
Kirkham, belonging to the Dean and Chapter of Christ Church,
in Oxford, and to the burgesses inhabitants of the borough of
Kirkham, are bounded east by the lands of Edward Robinson and
George Brown, lying within Newton and Scales; westward by
the lands of Sir Thomas Clifton, within Westby, and the lands of
Christopher Parker, esq., lying in Ribby with Wrea; northwards
by the lands of Mrs. Dorʸ. Westby, of Mowbreck, and the lands of
Mr. Edward Fleetwood, of Wesham; and southwards by the lands
of Mr. George Sharples, of Freckleton.”</p>

<p>It has already been shown that the manor was conveyed by the
authorities at Oxford to Thomas Fleetwood as fee-farmer in 1601,
and that the lease was subsequently renewed or confirmed to his
son and heir Sir Richard Fleetwood. Before 1700, however,
probably about 1650, from the contents of a petition presented by
the inhabitants to the dean and chapter in 1705, the Cliftons, of
Lytham, had the manor in a tenure similar to that of their predecessors,
and held each year, in the month of June, a court leet,
at which the two bailiffs were elected. The late Thomas Langton
Birley, esq., of Carr Hill, Kirkham, acquired the lordship by
purchase a short time previous to his death in 1874, when it
descended to his son and heir, Henry Langton Birley, esq.
Bailiffs still continue to be annually appointed, and have in their
hands several charitable bequests, the interest arising therefrom
being devoted to the service of the poor of the township, either in
the form of alms, or in maintaining some useful convenience, as
the parish pump, for their benefit. The property at present
belonging to the bailiffs consists of one meadow, situated behind
the Roman Catholic church; a garden in front of the same edifice;
a plot in the field called the “Iron Latch”; and a pew in the
parish church of Kirkham. In 1676 the bishop of Chester acceded
to a petition from the minister and churchwardens that a wainscot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_380"></a>[380]</span>
might be placed so as to enclose the bailiffs’ pew, “which seat, for
want thereof, was pressed into and thronged by others to the

transacted, stood in the Market-place until about the year 1790,
when it was accidentally burnt down. This building was erected
in two stories, the upper of which was divided into a small room,
used for flax dressing at the time the Hall was destroyed, and a
larger one, devoted to court meetings and other public matters,
which was separated from the remainder of the edifice insomuch
as it could only be entered from the outside by means of a flight
of stone steps. The ground floor or lower story was converted
into shops in the occupation of tradesmen of the town. The
original borough seal, which still exists, although somewhat
defective, represents a dove bearing an olive branch in its beak.
Notwithstanding that Kirkham was made a borough, during the
last years of the thirteenth century, it never appears upon any
occasion to have returned a Member of Parliament, and it may
safely be conjectured that no writ for that purpose was ever
issued to the burgesses, as the sheriffs exercised a discretionary
power in such matters, and consequently only those boroughs,
whose inhabitants seemed affluent enough to support the expenses
of an election, were selected for the honour, amongst which it is
scarcely likely Kirkham would be classed.</p>

<p>A market cross stood in the centre of the town, near to the
ancient Moot Hall, about the beginning of this century, but has
now, like the stocks, which originally had their place in the
churchyard and afterwards were removed to a more public site,
been long numbered amongst the memories of a past and less
refined age. There is no allusion to a whipping post in any of
the old documents, but we have the authority of a gentleman who
witnessed the spectacle, that a man was publicly whipped in the
Market-place fifty years ago.</p>

<p>The “Thirty Sworn men of Kirkham” was the name given to a
council which took cognizance of parochial affairs, and of certain
matters connected with the church, amongst other things
appointing the churchwardens. This assembly was composed of
representatives from the different sections of the parish, two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_381"></a>[381]</span>
persons being elected from each of the fifteen townships as
under:—</p>

<p>The oath taken by the “Sworn men” was administered by the
civil authorities, and their tenure of office was for life, or until
they thought proper to resign. The origin of “Sworn men,” or
at least of the name, dates from the fourteenth century, and the
institution itself seems to have been common in this part of
Lancashire; Preston, Lancaster, Garstang, and Goosnargh, having
had assemblies bearing similar titles and performing similar duties,
but consisting only of twenty-four men each.</p>

<p>In 1636 a serious dispute arose between the Thirty-men and the
vicar, the Rev. Edward Fleetwood, owing to the latter requiring
the council to subscribe to the following conditions:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“1st. They shall lay no gauld themselves without the consent of the vicar.</p>

<p>2nd. That the vicar shall have a negative voice in all their proceedings, and
that they shall determine nothing without the consent of the said vicar.</p>

<p>3rd. They shall not put or elect any new 30-men without the vicar’s consent.</p>

<p>4th. They shall not meet in the church upon any business whatever, unless
they acquaint the vicar before.</p>

<p>5th. If there be any turbulent or factious person, that the rest of the company
shall join with the vicar and turn him out.”<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

</div>

<p>On the Thirty-men refusing to comply with his request, the
vicar excluded them “by violence” from their usual meeting-place<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_382"></a>[382]</span>
in the church, and on the 5th of November, 1638, when
they were called upon by the churchwardens to attend there in
order to lay the necessary taxes for the repair of the sacred
edifice, then much decayed, Mr. Fleetwood “locked himself in
the church, as before he had many times done,” and compelled
them to conduct their business without the building.</p>

<p>Incensed at the persistent hostility of the vicar an appeal against
his conduct was made by the “men” to the archbishop of York,
and by him referred to the bishop of Chester, who replied:—“That
the corporation or company of 30-men, not having any
warranty from the king, was nothing in law; but if the parish or
township did delegate the power to the 30-men as to church
matters, then their acts relating thereunto were as effectual and
binding as if they had the king’s sanction; and wishing to know
the affection of the parishioners on this head, he issued an order on
22 Nov. 1638, that public notice shᵈ be given in the church for
all the parishioners to meet and give their voices whether they
chose that the custom of the 30-men representing the whole parish
two for every township, should continue, or they should be
dissolved.”<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Fleetwood having ignored this order, the churchwardens
took upon themselves the duty of calling a general conference of
the parishioners; a great multitude assembled in the churchyard,
where the meeting was held, the vicar having locked the church
door, and declared in favour of their ancient custom being continued
and preserved to their posterity as it had come down to
them, freely giving “their power and strength to the said 30-men,
to confer and determine all church matters.”</p>

<p>To this resolution were appended the signatures of four
hundred and ninety-four persons, amongst whom were Thomas
Clifton of Westby and Clifton, John Westby of Mowbreck,
Thomas Hesketh of Mains, Edward Veale of Whinney Heys,
John Parker of Bradkirk, and Edward Bradley of Bryning.</p>

<p>The bishop of Chester, having received an official report of the
result of the meeting, communicated with the archbishop of
York, as below stated:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“Chester palace, 14 Dec. 1638.</p>

<p>“Seeing the vicar (whom I have used with all gentleness and lenity), continues<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_383"></a>[383]</span>
still in his contempt, and addeth daily more forwardness thereunto, I must return
the petitioners to my lord’s grace of York, to be ordered by the high commissioner
according to his grace’s intimation signified in his.... I wish well to
the sillie wilful man, but he makes himself incapable thereof.</p>

<p class="right">“John Cestriensis.”<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This effort to obtain redress for their grievances does not
appear to have been attended with a success equal to the expectations
of the “thirty,” for a little later they instituted a suit in
the consistory court at Chester against the vicar, “and, having
proved their practice good, had sentence against him and
£20 7s. 6d. allowed towards their expenses.”<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> The “Thirty-men”
were admitted into the church on Easter Tuesday, 1639.</p>

<p>During the period that Edward Fleetwood was vicar of Kirkham
an event occurred in the parish which furnishes a forcible example
of the superstitious feeling in religious matters existing amongst
all ranks of the people at that time. The whole of the details of
the circumstance are embodied in a pamphlet entitled “Strange
Signs from Heaven,” and by way of an introduction, the tract
contains this certificate, “under the hand of Mr. Edward Fleetwood,
minister of Kirkham parish in Lancashire, concerning the
monster brought forth by Mrs. Haughton, a papist, living in that
parish:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“As we must tell no lie, so we should conceal no truth; especially when it tends
to God’s glory: There was a great papist, and of great parentage, within the
parish of Kirkham, and his wife’s mother, being of the same religion, did usually
scoff and mock the Roundheads, and, in derision of Mr. Prinne and others, cut off
the cat’s ears, and called it by his name: But behold an example of the justice
and equity of God in his judgements; as Adonibezec was repaid in his own kind;
Haman hanged upon the same gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai; and
Pharoah and all his host drowned in the sea, into which he had thought to have
driven the Israelites. And likewise one of the popish prelates, who said he
would not dine till Ridley and Latimer were burnt, was burnt in his own
entrails. So it fell out with this man’s wife, a popish creature, who being great
with child, when the time of her delivery came, she brought forth a monstrous
child without a head, ugly and deformed, myself eyewitness thereof.</p>

<p class="right">Edward Fleetwood, pastor.</p>

<p class="right">W. Greenacres, midwife.”</p>

</div>

<p>The tract itself informs us that in the course of a conversation
with some gentlemen, Mrs. Haughton observed with great
warmth that “the Puritans and Independents deserved all to be
hanged,” and concluded her uncharitable remarks by uttering a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_384"></a>[384]</span>
fervent wish that neither she nor any one belonging to her might
ever become Roundheads; upon which “answer was made to her,
that her children, if she had any, might (if God so pleased) have
their eyes opened, and see that good which she was ignorant of.
Mrs. Haughton retorted in these words: <i>I pray God that
rather than I shall be a Roundhead, or bear a Roundhead, I
may bring forth a child without a head.</i>” In course of time, as
we learn from the pamphlet, she was delivered of a monster child,
being attended in her confinement by “widow Greenacres, the
midwife, formerly wife to Mr. Greenacres, some time vicar of this
parish,” who, “being a godly woman, could not be eased in her
mind until she had discharged her conscience in making it known
to Mr. Fleetwood.” “For better satisfaction Mr. Fleetwood
caused the grave to be opened, and the child to be taken out and
laid to view, and found there a body without a head, as the
midwife had said, only the child had a face on the breast of it,
two eyes near unto the place where the paps usually are, and a
nose upon the chest, and a mouth a little above the navel, and
two ears, upon each shoulder one.”</p>

<p>The certificate of the vicar relating to this discovery, together
with a manuscript account of the circumstances connected with
it, were “brought up to London by Colonel Moore (of Liverpool)
a member of the House of Commons, and shewed to divers of the
House; who commanded the tract to be printed so that all the
kingdom might see the hand of God therein; to the comfort of
his people, and the terror of the wicked that deride and scorn
them.”<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<p>In the context are enumerated a few records of the “Thirty
men,” in order that the reader may have a clearer conception of
their duties, and gain some information, not devoid of interest,
respecting the more common-place matters associated with the
history and regulation of parochial and church affairs in the

<p>The first church of Kirkham is commonly said to have been
erected by the Saxons on Mill Hill, and subsequently rebuilt on
its present site, but as this statement is unsupported by any more
reliable evidence than tradition, we give it simply for what it is
worth. The earliest authentic word of Kirkham church is in
1512, when the edifice was in part rebuilt; and at that time, and
doubtless for centuries before, it occupied the same situation as
to-day. After the alterations and renewals had been completed,
the building comprised a nave, chancel, and side aisles, separated
by stone pillars, on which rested pointed arches. At the west
end of the church, throughout its entire width, was erected a
gallery, another of less extent being placed at the east end for
the accommodation of the organ. The north aisle contained a
small gallery belonging to the ffrance family, the private chapel
of the Westbys of Mowbreck, and a spacious room or vestry, in
which the “Thirty-men” held their meetings. In the south aisle
was located the private oratory of the Cliftons, of Westby and
Clifton. The chancel extended the width of the nave and south
aisle, and in 1780 the Clifton chapel was, with the consent of its
proprietor, enclosed within the communion rails. The reading
desk stood against the central pillar of the north side of the nave,
and immediately above it was placed the pulpit. The north wall
was low, and contained several large windows. The whole of
the building, with the exception of the chancel, which possessed a
double-gabled roof, was covered in by a single roof, which slanted
from the south to the north wall, and was pierced at each end
with dormer windows. The main entrance was protected by a
massive porch.</p>

<p>The tower was probably erected but little later, if not, indeed,
at the time the church was rebuilding, as appears from the will
here quoted, bearing the date 29th of July, 1512:—“I, Cuthbert
Clifton, Squyer, desire to be buryed at Kirkham in the tombe
where Rychard Clifton, my great grandfather was buryed; I
bequeath £6 13s. 4d. towards buyldyng of the steple of the saide
churche.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_387"></a>[387]</span></p>

<p>This tower was embattled with a short pinnacle at each corner,
and stood about sixty feet high; on a stone in one of the buttresses
were carved the arms and name of Cuthbert Clifton. In
the inside wall of the present tower there is fixed a stone bearing
traces of an inscription, and it is probable, from the remnant of a
name still discernible upon it, that this is the stone here referred
to.</p>

<p>From the records of the “Thirty-men” are learnt several things
of interest with regard to the church, and amongst them, that
during the seventeenth century the edifice was used occasionally
for scholastic purposes, thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">“1653-54.</p>

<p>“6 Jan. It was agreed (by the “Thirty-men”) that no scriffener be suffered to
teach in the church, unless he procure some honest townsmen of Kirkham to
pass their word that whatsoever his scholars do, either in breaking glass or in
abusing men’s seats—and that they meddle not with the bells—he shall make
good what they abuse.”</p>

</div>

<p>In 1662 a font was erected at a cost of £2 5s. 4d., and most
likely is the one now stationed in the tower entrance to the
church. A bone house was built in 1679 in the recess or corner
formed by the west wall of the north aisle and the north side of
the tower, in obedience to the order of the bishop of the diocese.
In 1724 gates were placed at the entrance to the churchyard, and
in 1799 the old tithe barn which formed the westerly boundary of
this plot of ground was blown down and destroyed; the stone for
the gate pillars was obtained from Ribchester. The following
lists of persons buried in the Clifton and Westby chapels, or
quyres, as they were called, were given in an old document which
was copied in 1790 by Mr. W. Langton, who described it as
“much defaced and torn:”—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">“In the Clifton Quire.</p>

<p>“1597, sir Geo Cowbrone and Mr. Cuthbert Clifton; 1598, Henry Colbron of
Frekleton; 1601, Mr. Skillicorne; 1604, ould Dorothie Skillicorne, Mr. Skillicorne’s
daughter; 1602, Mr. Skillicorne, his wiff, Mr. Skillicorne, his son, and
Henry Brown of Scales; 1604, Lawrence Cowbrone, eldest son of above; 1616,
Henry Porter of Treales; 1621, Mrs. Jane Anderton, died at Westby; 1625,
Mr. John Sharples, of Frekleton; 1630, uxor Arthur Sharples, and Matthew
Colbron of Frekleton.”</p>

<p class="center">“In the Westby Quyre.</p>

<p>“1605, Mr. Westby and Mr. John Westby (Mr. Thos. eldest brother); 1622,
ould Mr. Hesketh; 1623, Mr. Hesketh of Maines.”</p>

</div>

<p>In a note we are told that when Mr. Skillicorne died in 1601,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_388"></a>[388]</span>
“and was to be buried, Seth Woods of Kirkham and another
with him stood at Mr. Clifton’s quyre dore to keep them from
making a grave, and William Hull of Singleton did run at the
door with wood and break it open—how it ended is forgotten,
but he was buried there.”</p>

<p>In 1822 the nave of the church was pulled down and rebuilt by
aid of a rate imposed on all the townships; an inscription
commemorating this event was placed over the arch of the old
chancel. The tower and spire as they now exist were erected in
1844, whilst the present chancel was built in 1853. The spire
and tower together have an altitude of one hundred and fifty feet,
and the foundation stone of the latter was laid by Thomas Clifton,
esq., of Lytham, on the 21st of November, 1843. The tower
contains a peal of eight bells, but none of them are of ancient
date, those alluded to in the records of the “Thirty-men” having
been sold and replaced by fresh ones. The modern church of
Kirkham, which, like its predecessor, is dedicated to St. Michael,
is a large and handsome structure, built of Longridge stone, and
capable of holding about eighteen hundred persons; the chancel
is ornamented with a castellated parapet and fluted cornice. A
stone coffin, which may be seen outside the church at the east,
was taken out of the ground when the chancel was rebuilt. In
1725 the sum of £500 was left in trust by William Grimbaldson,
M.D., to be expended in the purchase of land and other property,
the income from which had to be devoted to providing a suitable
person or persons to read prayers twice every day of the week
except Sunday, in the parish church of Kirkham; in the event
of this condition of the bequest not being fulfilled, it was decreed
by the will that the annual interest of the money should be
distributed amongst the poor housekeepers of Treales; so far,
however, the requirement of the trust has been conformed to, and
prayers are still read twice daily in the church.</p>

<p>Within the ancient church of Kirkham, doubtless in the Clifton
chapel, was a chantry founded during the fifteenth century by
Richard Clifton, of Clifton, who married Alice, the daughter of
John Butler, of Rawcliffe Hall; and called the chantry of the
“Holy Crucifix,” as well as that of “Our Blessed Laydy.” The
commissioners of Henry VIII. issued the following report concerning
it:—</p>

<p>This chantry was in existence in 1452, for in that year, when
the abbot and convent of Vale Royal presented Dom. Edmund
Layche to the vicarage, the archdeacon instructed John Clarke,
the chaplain of the chantry, to induct him.<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> Thomas Prymbett,
the officiating priest, was sixty years of age in 1548, and at that
date the town and parish of Kirkham contained 1700 “houselinge
people.” Five years later Thomas Prymbett received a pension of
£5.<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> His death occurred in 1564.</p>

<p>At the dissolution of monasteries, the chantry of Kirkham
church was mulcted in an annual rent of 6s. 2d., which was
ordered to be paid to the receiver of the Duchy. A lease of the
lands appertaining to the chantry was granted to Lawrence
Pembroke for a term of sixteen years.</p>

<p>In 1291 the living of Kirkham church was estimated in the
<i>Valor</i> of Pope Nicholas at £160 per annum, but at the dissolution
aforesaid it was valued at no more than £21 1s. 0½d. per annum.</p>

<p>In 1586 the advowson of the church was leased to James Smith,
yeoman, of Kirkham; and in 1591 it was granted for a period of
twenty-one years by the authorities of Christ Church, Oxford, to
John Sharpies, of Freckleton.<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

<p>Within the church are several inscriptions, the oldest and
most curious of which is to be seen on a stone forming part of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_390"></a>[390]</span>
floor of the vestry, and covering the grave of vicar Clegg:—</p>

<p>In the church yard there are sundry inscribed stones, which,
although little interesting on the score of antiquity, are worthy
of mention as marking the burial places of persons of note in the
parish at one time; as—James Thistleton of Wrea, the founder
of Wrea school, who was interred on the 27th of February, 1693;
William Harrison of Kirkham, gent., interred January 12th,
1767, aged 60, who “left an ample fortune to poor relations, and
£140 to be vested in land, the yearly income to be distributed in
pious books to the poor of Kirkham, Little Eccleston, and
Larbrick: may the trustees dispense with integrity and effect the
sacred dole”; Edward King, esq., fourth son of the Very Rev.
James King, D.D., dean of Raphoe, “formerly bencher of the
honourable society of Gray’s inn, and for above twenty years
vice-chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster”; the “Rev. Charles
Buck of Kirkham, A.M., died 4 Jan. 1808. Aged 54,” also his
two sons; the Rev. Robert Loxham, vicar of Poulton, died in
1770, aged 80 years; and John Langton of Kirkham, died in
1762, aged 71 years; also many other members of the same family.</p>

<p>Respecting Kirkham’s less antiquated days it may be stated
that Messrs. Thomas Shepherd, John Birley, and John Langton
were the earliest to commence manufacturing on any large scale
there, which they accomplished during the first half of the
eighteenth century by establishing conjointly the flax spinning
mill still existing, but with many additions, as the firm of John
Birley and Sons. John Langton was descended from John
Langton, of Broughton Tower, through his fourth son, John,
who resided at Preston, and of whom Cornelius Langton, of
Kirkham, was the third son. On the 31st of March, 1696,
Cornelius Langton paid 30s. for his trade freedom in Kirkham,
where he married Elizabeth, daughter of Zachary Taylor, M.A.,
head-master of the Grammar School, by whom he had issue
John, Abigail, Zachary, and Roger. Abigail died in 1776;
Zachary entered the church, and espoused the daughter of
Alexander Butler, of Kirkland; Roger died in 1727; and John,
the eldest, opened, in conjunction with the two gentlemen just
named, a mercantile house in Kirkham, and left issue by his wife
Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Brown, of Ashtree Hall, Kirkham,—Anne,
Sarah, Cornelius, Thomas, of Kirkham, and five other
children. The children of Thomas Langton, by his wife Jane,
the eldest daughter of William Leyland, of Blackburn, were
Elizabeth, Leyland, Cornelius, Zachary, Cicely, and William, of
Kirkham, born 1758, died 1814. John Birley was the son of John
Birley of Skippool, and the ancestor of the large families of
Birley, at Kirkham, Manchester, etc. The mills at present
standing in the neighbourhood of Kirkham are the flax mill of
Messrs. John Birley and Sons, employing about 1,600 hands;
the weaving shed of Messrs. Walker and Barrett, 400 hands; the
cotton mill of Messrs. Harrison and Company, 150 hands; the
cotton mill of Messrs. Richards and Parker, 180 hands; the
weaving shed of Messrs. Richards Brothers, 84 hands; and the
Fylde Manufacturing Company in Orders Lane, a newly-established
concern. John Langton, who started in business at
Kirkham as a flax spinner, purchased, in company with Ann<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_393"></a>[393]</span>
Hankinson, in 1760, two years before his death, two closes of
land, with their appurtenances, in Freckleton, called Bannister
Flatt and Freckleton Croft, containing by estimate 1½ acres, and
12 beast-gates upon Freckleton Marsh, all of which they conveyed
by indenture in four months to John Dannet, Thomas Langton,
and William Shepherd, in trust for the educating, teaching, and
instructing, free from all charge, of such young girls within the
township of Kirkham, as they in their discretion should make
choice of, to read, knit, and sew; and that they should for that
purpose meet twice a year, on the 25th of December and the 24th
of June, at Kirkham, to make choice of proper subjects, and keep
a book, wherein should be entered the accounts of the receipts
and disbursements. During the ten years which elapsed after
1760 additional benefactions were received amounting to £440.
By indenture, dated 2nd of March, 1772, Joseph Brockholes and
Constantia, his wife, conveyed to William Shepherd and Thomas
Langton, trustees of the school, their heirs and assigns, for the
sum of £425, two cottages, with appurtenances, in Freckleton,
with a garden containing 36 perches; a parcel of ground in a
meadow in Freckleton, called Birl Brick Meadow, embracing 30
perches; one cowgate in Freckleton Marsh; five closes in Freckleton,
named the Two Baker Meadows, the Two Lamma Leaches,
and the Bank, holding six acres of customary measurement.
From 1772 to 1813 further donations (£130) were received. The
trusteeship of the school appears to have descended in the
Langton family, and was held by the late Thomas Langton
Birley, esq., whose father, Thomas Birley, had married Anne, the
daughter and co-heiress of John Langton, of Kirkham. Clothing,
as well as education, is supplied gratuitously to the scholars, who
usually amount to 40, or thereabouts. A new building for the
purposes of the school was erected on a fresh site a few years ago,
in place of the former one, which had stood since 1761.</p>

<p>The Roman Catholics, through the munificence of the Rev.
Thomas Sherburne, built a magnificent church at the Willows in
1844-5. The edifice comprises a nave, side aisles, chancel, south
porch, and an elegant spire, having an altitude of 110 feet. On
the south side of the chancel is the lady chapel, and opposite to it
that of the holy cross. The high altar is beautifully sculptured in
Caen stone, and the reredos and tabernacle are covered with rich<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_394"></a>[394]</span>
guilding. The walls contain several noble windows of stained
glass. This church superseded one which had been erected in
the same locality in 1809, anterior to which the chapel attached
to Mowbreck Hall had been used by the Romanists of the neighbourhood
for their celebrations and services. The Independents
and Wesleyans also have places of worship in the town, situated
respectively in Marsden and Freckleton Streets. The chapel of
the Independents was constructed about 1793, and rebuilt in 1818,
but that of the Wesleyans is of more recent origin. At the
Willows, it should be mentioned, there is a school, open to all
denominations, but under Roman Catholic supervision, which
was established about 1828. Kirkham was first illuminated with
gas in 1839. It contains a County Court House<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> and the Workhouse
of the Fylde Union,<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> in addition to several other public
buildings, as a Police Station, Waterworks’ Office, National and
Infant Schools, etc. The town is governed by a Local Board of
Health.</p>

<p>No papers have so far been discovered throwing any light upon
the origin of the Free Grammar School, and the earliest intimation
of its existence is in 1551, when Thomas Clifton, of Westby,
bequeathed “towards the grammar scole xxˢ.” Thirty-four years
later it was arranged amongst the “Thirty-men” that “40s. taken
out of the clerk’s wages should be paid to the schoolmaster, and
that 4 of the 30-men in the name of the rest should take possession
of the school-house in right of the whole parish, to be kept
in repair by it and used as a school-house;” also that “Richard
Wilkins, now schoolmaster,” should be retained in his office for a
year or longer. In 1589 the above assembly “agreed that the 10s.
a year pᵈ by Goosnargh to the church shᵈ in future be paid to the
schoolmaster, and for every burial (except one dying in childbed)
he shᵈ have such sum as was agreed by the 30-men, and
also such sum as hath heretofore been paid for the holy loaf,
which is of every house 3d., every Sunday successively towards
repairs of the schoolhouse and help of his wages.” In 1592 this
order, as far as regards the holy-loaf contributions, was rescinded,
the money as in former times going to the vicar.</p>

<p>The following is from the copy of an ancient manuscript<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_395"></a>[395]</span>
account of the school, from 1621 to 1663, formerly in the possession
of Thomas Martin, esq., of Lincoln’s Inn:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Isabell Birly, wife of Thomas Birly, born in Kirkham, daughter of John
Coulbron, an alehouse keeper all her life, and through that employment attayned
to a good personall estait above most in that towne of that calling, being moved
with a naturall compassion to pore children shee saw often in that towne, was
heard to say dyvers tymes she would doe something for their good, and in the
yeare 1621, having gotten a good stock of money in her hands, was moved to put
her sayings into action. The 30-men of the parish being assembled at the church,
she, with £30 in her apron, came to them, telling them she had brought that
money to give it towards the erecting of a free schole for pore children to be
taught gratis, whose parents were not able to lay out money for their teaching,
wishing them to take it and consider of it. They were the men especially trusted
by the parish for the common benefits of the church, and therefore were the most
like persons to move their severall townships to contribute every one something
towards the accomplishment of so charitable a work, and not doubting that their
good examples in their contributions would be a strong motive to excite others.
This gift was thankfully accepted, and wrought so with them that every one was
forward to promote it, especially Mr. Jno. Parker of Bredkirk, an eminent man in
the parish and one of that companie, being at that tyme one of the earl of Derbie’s
gentlemen and somewhat allied to the said Isabell; he forwarded it very much,
sparing neither his paynes of his bodie nor his purse; for that end he travelled all
the parish over to every particular towne and house earnestly persuading them to
contribute to so good an use. Sir Cuthbert Clifton gave £20, Maister Westby of
Moulbreck £10, Mr. Parker £5, Mr. Langtree of Swarbreck £5, Mr. Hesketh of
Maines 40s., Mr. Greenacres, vicar of Kirkham, £4, and the several townships in
the parish gave as followeth:—Kirkham near £30, but not out; Ribby and Wray
£3 8s. 6d.; Westby and Plumpton 16s. 4d.; Weeton £7 2s.; Singleton £1 13s. 6d.;
Little Eccleston and Larbrick 4s. 4d.; Greenall and Thistleton £4 16s.; Roseacre
£7 2s.; Wharles £1 13s.; Treales £8 4s.; Medlar and Wesham £1 5s.; Hambleton
4s. 6d.; Salwick £3 5s.; Clifton £3 7s.; Newton and Scales £3 5s.; Freckleton
£8; Warton £1 8s.; Bryning and Kellamer £4 13s.—in the whole £170 14s.”</p>

</div>

<p>When the time came for the selection of a suitable person to
undertake the charge and education of the pupils, it so happened
“that at that instant a young man, an honest, able scholar of good
gifts and parts, having a lingering sickness upon him, was come
over to Kirkham to Mr. William Armesteed (the curate of Kirkham),
his cozen, for change of air, his name being Thomas Armesteed,
and he was moved by some of the towne whether he would
accept to be schole master if suit were made to the 30-men to
elect him; he, in regard to the weakness of his bodie then yielded
to the motion, otherwise he was a man well qualified for the
ministery and a moving preacher.”<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_396"></a>[396]</span></p>

<p>At the meeting of the “Thirty-men” to fill up the appointment
there were two candidates, Mr. Armesteed and Mr. Sokell, but
the former was elected. About the year 1628, when this gentleman
resigned, Mr. Sokell was elected to the vacancy after a
contest. Until 1628 the management of all matters connected
with the school had rested with the “Thirty-men,” but at that
date the Roman Catholic gentlemen, who had been most liberal
in their contributions, came to the conclusion that “it was not
for their reputation altogether to leave the care of it to others
and they to have no hand in it, therefore they took upon
them to have a hand about it, and upon their doing so the 30
men, being tenants most of them to some of them, or dependant
someway upon them, left it to them; only Mr. Parker was not
bound to the <i>gentlemen</i>, and he joined in with them.”<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p>Isabell Birley and others had brought out a candidate, named
Dugdall, at the recent election of schoolmaster, and were so
incensed at his defeat by Mr. Sokell, a Romanist, that they drew
up a petition to the bishop of Chester, complaining that “the
gentlemen of the parish, being recusants all saving Mr. Parker,
had intruded themselves to order all things” about the free school,
and begging his lordship to issue an order how the future election
of feofees for the school should be made, which he accordingly
did, as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“Apud, Wigan, 31 July, 1628.</p>

<p>“At which day and place diverse of the Town and Parish of Kirkham appeared
about the ordering of a schole master thereof for the time to come. At their
request it is therefore ordered that the whole parish, or as many as shall appear at
some day prefixed, after public notice given the Sunday before, shall elect six or
nine lawful and honest men feofees for that purpose, whereof a third part to be
chosen by the towne of Kirkham, and the two other parts by the parishioners
generally, of which feofees Isabell Wilding’s (late Birley) husband and her heirs,
because she gave £30 to the schole maister, shall be one.</p>

<p class="right">“Johannes Cestrensis. Edwᵈ Russell.”</p>

</div>

<p>The command of the bishop to call a public meeting was carried
out, and in answer to the summons, read in church as directed,
only seven persons presented themselves in “the parlour of Mr.
Brown the curate,” viz., Sir Cuthbert Clifton, knt., Mr. Thomas
Westby, Mr. Thomas Hesketh, Mr. Langtree, Mr. John Parker,
gentleman, and of the parishioners, “not one man saving Richard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_397"></a>[397]</span>
Harrison of Freckleton, and John Wilding of Kirkham; and
then and there the gentlemen elected themselves feofees, as also
they elected Mr. Edward Fleetwood, the vicar.”<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<p>After the death of John Wilding in 1634, as his widow, Isabell,
found herself growing more infirm, she waited on the feofees with
the intention of supplementing her original donation of £30 with
an additional one of equal value, if she found them “favourable to
her in something she willed of them, whereas Mr. Clifton gave
her harsh words and such as sent her home with much discontent
and passion.” When she died in 1637, it was discovered, as the
manuscript from which we have been quoting informs us, that
she had “left the £30 by will to buy land with, and the yearly
rent to be divided to the poor of the town and parish of
Kirkham.”</p>

<p>During the struggles between king and parliament, the school
was closed for several years, and re-opened with fresh governors
or feofees. At that epoch the inhabitants were kept in a state of
constant excitement and alarm by visits from either the royal or
parliamentary forces, but fortunately no collision ever took place
in the neighbourhood.<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>

<p>By the will, dated 1655, of Henry Colborne, of London, a native
of Kirkham, his trustees were requested to purchase the lease of
the rectory of this town, and invest the profits, with the exception
of £100 per annum, for sixteen years, in lands for the benefit of
schools; the purchases were to be settled on the Drapers’ Company
of London. In 1673, £69 10s. was obtained for the school,
being the rent of lands bought in the metropolis by the Colborne
trustees, £45 of which sum had to be paid to the head master,
who was required to be “a university man, and obliged to preach
once a month at least in the parish church or in some of the
chapels;” £16 16s. of the remainder was apportioned to the
second master; and £8 to provide an usher.<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<p>In 1673 it was decreed by the Court of Chancery that the
expense and duty of preserving the school-house in proper repair
should devolve upon the township of Kirkham, whilst the election
of masters should rest exclusively with the Drapers’ Company.<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_398"></a>[398]</span></p>

<p>In that year also lands, etc., at Nether Methop in Westmoreland
to the value of £530 were purchased, according to the directions
of the will of the Rev. James Barker, rector of Thrandeston,
Suffolk, which required his executors to buy lands sufficient to
yield an annual rent of £30, and to settle such property on ten
trustees, elected by the bailiffs and principal burgesses of Kirkham;
the trustees were ordered to apply the rental to the following
uses:—£10 yearly to the schoolmaster; £12 yearly in half-yearly
instalments, as an “exhibition or allowance to such poor scholer
of the towne as shall then be admitted to the university,” such
exhibition to be open to any pupil born in Kirkham and educated
at the school, and in case no scholar was ready and fitted to take
advantage of it the sum was to be used in binding out poor
apprentices; £5 for the purpose of binding apprentices; and the
remainder to be expended in defraying the cost of an annual
dinner for the trustees when they met to “enquire concerning the
demeanure of the scholler at the univerty,” in whose case it was
appointed that if they should find him “to be riotously given, or
disordered and debauched, they should withdraw the exhibition.”</p>

<p>In 1701, the Drapers’ Company issued the following order
touching the admission of girls to the benefits of the charity:—
“From henceforth no female sex shall have any conversation, or
be taught, or partake of any manner of learning whatsoever in
the free school at Kirkham, any former custom to the contrary
notwithstanding.”</p>

<p>In 1725 £400 was bequeathed to the trustees of the school by
William Grimbaldson, M.D., to be invested in lands, and the
rental to be added to the stipend of the head-master, if “he
should be a scholar bred at Westminster, Winchester, or Eton,
and a master of arts,” but if not the rental to be devoted to
binding apprentices, for which purpose it is used at present. In
addition this physician left £50 to be similarly invested, and the
income to be spent in buying classical books for the school. The
management of the school has been in the hands of trustees from
the time of Barker’s bequest.</p>

<p>Since the establishment of the exhibition under Barker’s trust
twenty-eight youths have been assisted in their university careers
by its means.</p>

<p>From the vestry book of Kirkham, we learn that the charity
known as “Bread Money” originated from the vicar and “Thirty-men,”
who, on the 5th of April, 1670, “with the consent and
countenance of some of the gentlemen and of the present churchwardens,
with some neighbours of repute in the respective
townships,” held a meeting, at which it was unanimously decided
to raise £80, such sum to be laid out on good security, and the
interest to be expended in providing “a dozen penny loaves for
every Sunday in the year, Christmas and the king’s birthday, and
for every other holiday, to be given to so many of such poor as
shall use to frequent the church and to those of distant townships.”
The resolution continued:—“These loaves shall not be
given to strangers or vagabonds, nor to children that shall but
play about the church till sermon be passed, and then come in for
a loaf, nor to any of the town of Kirkham in summer, but only
in winter.” In order to raise the fund agreed upon, it was
resolved that “what could be got by contribution of the communicants
at Easter should be thus employed;” vicar Richard
Clegg promised £5, and stated that if he remained at Kirkham
during the rest of his life, and had the means, he would at some
future time give £15 more for the same object, an intention
which appears subsequently to have been carried out by his
daughter, Mrs. Mary Nightingale, who some years after his
decease, contributed £20 towards the fund. £5 given for the use<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_400"></a>[400]</span>
of the poor by Jane, wife of John Clifton; arrears of rent due from
Goosnargh; and funeral doles were all devoted to this purpose.
In 1867 the fund amounted to £102 2s., yielding an annual
income of £5 13s. 3d.</p>

<p>A sum of £12 was given by vicar Clegg, the interest to be paid
to the clergyman preaching a sermon in Kirkham church on
Easter Tuesday.</p>

<p>Richard Brown, by indenture dated 1639, conveyed for a term
of 999 years a close called New Moor Hey with appurtenances, in
Kirkham, to James Smith, upon condition that he, his heirs and
executors, should pay the yearly rent of 20s. at Martinmas. “It
is witnessed, that the said Richard Brown, in consideration of the
good will he bore to the town of Kirkham, and the inhabitants
thereof, and out of his zeal to God, and the charitable relief of the
poor, needful and impotent people within the said town, granted
to William Robinson and three others, their heirs and assigns,
the said yearly rent of 20s., to hold the same upon trust, and to
dispose of it amongst so many of the people of the said town, as
the bailiffs thereof for the time being should, in their discretion,
think most needful, on St. Thomas’s day.”<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<p>By indenture, dated 1734, Joseph Hankinson, of Kirkham, in
consideration of £45 released and conveyed to Robert Hankinson,
and four others a close in Kirkham, called Swarbreck’s Old Earth,
containing, by estimate, 1½ acres, to hold the same to themselves
and their heirs for ever; and in the deed it was declared that the
consideration money belonged to the poor of the township, and
that the grantees were only trustees of the same, and had laid it
out by direction of the inhabitants for the benefit of the poor
according to the wish of the benefactors. The indenture is
endorsed:—“Conveyance of Swarbreck’s Old Earth, for the use
of the poor of Kirkham, purchased by monies given by Mrs. Clegg,
widow of the Rev. Richard Clegg, vicar, and Mrs. Phœbe Sayle,
wife of Mr. Charles Sayle, to wit £20 by the former, and £20 by
the latter.”</p>

<p>Thomas Brockholes, by an indenture of 1755, conveyed for £50
to John Langton and William Shepherd, their heirs and assigns,
a close called Moor Hey, with appurtenances; and subsequently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_401"></a>[401]</span>
in 1768 William Shepherd conveyed the close then denominated
the Bailiffs’ Moor Hey to Henry Lawson, yeoman, of Kirkham, who
in the following year being moved by “divers good causes and
considerations” sold to the Rev. Charles Buck, vicar of Kirkham,
and twelve others, all of Kirkham, gentlemen, for the sum of five
shillings, two plots of land in Kirkham township, one of which,
called Moorcroft, contained a rood and four perches, and the other,
Swarbreck’s Old Earth, comprised an acre and an half. The
conditions were that all profits or income accruing from the lands
should be used for the relief of the poor of the aforesaid township.<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>On the 1st of December, 1739, a legacy of £40 was bequeathed
to trustees by Elizabeth Brown, to be invested, and the interest
applied to the relief of the poor and necessitous widows of
Kirkham, or the neighbouring townships, at Michaelmas.</p>

<p>The sum of £140 was received under the will, dated 1767, of
William Harrison of Kirkham, to be invested, and the interest to
be expended in Common Prayer books, Bibles, etc., two-thirds of
which were to be given to the poor of this town, and the
remainder to the poor of Little Eccleston and Larbrick.<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>

<p>In 1816 Mrs. Mary Bradkirk placed £320 in the navy, five per
cents. in her own name and that of Zachary Langton, esq., of
Bedford Row, London; and subsequently trustees of this fund
were appointed, whose duty it was to distribute the interest as
follows:—</p>

<p>That of £100 amongst five necessitous persons in the township
of Kirkham for life, and each vacancy to be filled up immediately
after the death of the former recipient.</p>

<p>That of £20 to Joseph Brewer, then parish clerk of Kirkham,
for life, and after his demise to the person filling the office of
sexton at the same place.</p>

<p>That of £100 to five poor persons of Ribby-with-Wrea, and
that of the last £100 to five poor persons of Bryning-with-Kellamergh,
the vacancies to be treated as in those of Kirkham.</p>

<p>The only requirement on the part of the pensioners being that
they should be members of the Church of England. The income
of this charity, which amounts to more than £10 a year, like
those of the five preceding it, forms part of the bailiffs’ fund.</p>

<p class="dropcap">In the Domesday Book Freckeltun is stated to contain
four carucates of arable soil. During the reign of
Henry III. Richard de Freckleton, Allan de Singleton,
and Iwan de Freckleton, with three others, held land
in Freckleton from the earl of Lincoln. In 1311 the heirs of
Adam de Freckleton held Freckleton from Alice, the daughter
and heiress of the earl of Lincoln, shortly after which Ralph de
Freckleton was lord of the manor. Gilbert de Singleton had a
house with 12 acres of land and a mill there in 1325. In 1349
the manor was held under the earl of Lancaster as follows:—Robert
de Freckleton, 1 messuage and 3 bovates; Nicholas le
Botiler, 1 messuage and 11 bovates; the heirs of Robert Sherburne,
2 bovates; the heirs of Sir Adam de Banastre, 2 bovates;
and Thomas de Singleton, 1 bovate. During the first half of the
16th century the Botilers or Butlers retained property in Freckleton,
whilst the Sherburnes held estates there until the early part
of the 17th century. Hugh Hilton Hornby, esq., of Ribby Hall,
is the largest territorial proprietor at present, but there are several
resident yeomen.</p>

<p>In 1834 a temporary episcopal chapel was erected, and 5 years
later the existing church was built, being a neat brick edifice,
with a spire at the west end, and containing an ancient pulpit
from Kirkham church. The Rev. G. H. Waterfall, M.A., was
the earliest incumbent, and the Rev. Walter Scott, appointed in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_403"></a>[403]</span>
1861, is now in charge. In 1718 a Quakers’ burial ground was
opened, but was closed in 1811. A meeting house was also
established by the same sect in 1720, and pulled down after
standing nearly a century. A Wesleyan chapel was erected in
1814; and in 1862 the Primitive Methodists opened another. A
National school was built in 1839, and is supported mainly by
subscriptions.</p>

<p>The village is long and irregular, but contains sundry better
class houses, and a cotton manufactory, belonging to Mr. Sowerbutts,
holding 320 looms. The inhabitants are chiefly employed
in making sacking, sailcloth, ropes, etc. There is also a
shipbuilding yard, of which Mr. Rawstorne is the proprietor,
where vessels, mostly for the coasting trade, are constructed.</p>

<p>The township comprises 2,659 statute acres.</p>

<p>Andrew Freckleton and two more gave, about 1734, certain
sums of money for the poor of Freckleton, the interest from which,
together with 10s. per annum left by Lawrence Webster for the
same object, amounts to £2 5s. a year. The township shares in
a bequest of £5, with Clifton and Newton-with-Scales, from
Elizabeth Clitherall, of Clifton, for the use of the poor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warton.</span> Wartun is entered in the survey of William the
Conqueror as comprising four carucates, and later, when in the
fee of the earl of Lincoln, the township was held by the manorial
lord of Wood Plumpton. During the reign of King John,
Thomas de Betham had the third of a knight’s fee in Warton.
Sir Ralph de Betham held Warton in the time of Edward III.,
and in 1296 Edmund Crouchback, earl of Lancaster, had a rent
charge of 3s. 4d. there. Gilbert de Singleton was possessed of a
messuage with six bovates of land in the township about 1325.
The manor was held by Johanna Standish and Richard Singleton
in 1515. John Talbot Clifton, esq., of Lytham Hall, is now the
most extensive owner of the soil.</p>

<p>The church of Warton, dedicated to St. Paul, was completed in
1722, but not consecrated until 1725. Within recent years it
has been apportioned a distinct parochial district under Lord
Blandford’s act.</p>

<p>The area of the township contains 3,939 statute acres.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bryning-with-Kellamergh.</span> The earliest allusion to this
township occurs in 1200-1, when Matilda Stockhord and others
held two carucates in Briscath Brunn and one carucate in
Kelgmersberg. A few years later Robert de Stockhord had the
fourth of a knight’s fee there. In 1253 Ralph Betham held
Brininge, Kelgermsarche, etc.; and during the reign of Edward
III. Sir Ralph de Betham possessed the fourth of a knight’s fee
in the same places, at which time John de Damport also held an
eighth of a carucate. In 1311 John Baskerville had 3½ bovates,
and Thurstan de Norley 4 bovates, in the hamlet of Kilgremargh.</p>

<p>In 1479 Sir Edward and William Betham had land in Bryning
and Kellamergh; and two years afterwards half of the manor was
granted by Edward IV. to Thomas Molyneux and his heirs.
Thomas Middleton held both Bryning and Kellamergh in 1641.
The Birley, Langton, Cross, and Smith families are now the chief
landowners in the township.</p>

<p>Bryning Hall and Leyland House are the only places of interest
amongst the scattered habitations. The Hall, now a farm-house,
was formerly the seat of the Bradkirks, whilst Leyland House,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_405"></a>[405]</span>
also converted to farm uses, was the residence of the Leylands,

<p><span class="smcap">Ribby-with-Wrea.</span> In Domesday Book <i>Rigbi</i>, for Ribby, is
entered as comprising six carucates. Roger de Poictou gave the
tithes of “colts, calves, lambs, kids, pigs, wheat, cheese, and butter
of Ribbi and Singletone” to the priory of Lancaster to serve as food
to the monks who celebrated mass in that monastery. This grant
was afterwards confirmed by John, earl of Moreton.<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> In 1201 Adam
and Gerard de Wra paid two marks to King John in order to gain
protection from the sheriff, who, it seems, was in the habit of
unjustly molesting them in their tenements.<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> The manors of
Preston, Riggeby, and Singleton were presented by Henry III. to
Edmund, earl of Lancaster, who in 1286 became engaged in a
dispute with the abbot of Vale Royal, which ultimately led to a
mandate being issued by Edward I., at Westminster, to the
sheriff of Lancaster, commanding him to draw a proper and just
boundary line between the lands of the disputants, because
the abbot complained that the earl had taken more territory
than he was legally entitled to by his fee, thereby encroaching
on the conventual possessions in Kirkham parish.<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> In 1297 earl
Edmund’s rents from Ribby-with-Wrea amounted in all to £19
19s.<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> per annum.</p>

<p>During the life of the first duke of Lancaster, Ribby contained
twenty houses, and twenty-one and three-fourths bovates of land
held by bondsmen at a rental of £19 16s. 4d.; and at that time
there were the following tenants in Ribby and Wrea:—Adam,
the son of Richard the clerk, who held five acres, and paid 4d.
per annum; Adam, the son of Jordani, one acre for 12d.; Roger
Culbray, three acres for 9d.; Richard de Wra, half a bovate for
5d.; Adam de Kelyrumshagh, half a bovate for 4d.; William de
Wogher, six acres for 2d.; John de Bredkyrke, half a bovate for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_406"></a>[406]</span>
9d.; William le Harpour, one bovate for 15d.; Giles, two acres
for 10d.; John de Bonk, one bovate and one acre for 10d.; John
le Wise, eleven acres for 7d.; and Adam de Parys, two bovates,
which were those of John le Harpour, for 3s., of free farm and two
marks. After the demise of a tenant it was the recognised custom
for his successor to pay double rent.<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> The rent days were the
feasts of the Annunciation of the Blessed Mary and of St.
Michael. H. H. Hornby, esq., of Ribby Hall, is the present
lord of the manor.</p>

<p>The remains of the ancient manor house on Wrea Green are
now used as a cottage; Ribby Hall, the seat of the Hornbys, is a
modern mansion, and was erected rather more than half a century
ago. The church of Ribby-with-Wrea owes its origin to the
trustees of Nicholas Sharples’s charity, who purchased a piece of
ground on Wrea Green in 1721, and, having subscribed sufficient
funds amongst themselves, erected a small chapel upon it. The
following year they obtained a license to hold divine service in
the building, and on the 20th of June, 1755, it was consecrated
by the bishop of Chester. At that date the church was endowed
with £400, half of which came from Queen Anne’s bounty, and
the other in equal portions from the charities of Thistleton and
Sharples. In 1762 the whole of this fund was invested in land in
Warton, and other sums amounting to £600, including a legacy
of £100 under the will of Thomas Benson in 1761, and further
donations from the Royal bounty before mentioned, were
expended in the purchase of land at Thistleton.<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<p>In 1846 the township of Westby, with the exception of Great
and Little Plumptons, was joined, by order of Council, to that of
Ribby-with-Wrea, and the whole converted into an ecclesiastical
district. In 1869 the title of the incumbent was changed from
that of perpetual curate to vicar.</p>

<p>The old church was pulled down and the foundation stone of
the existing structure laid in 1848, by the Rev. G. L. Parsons,
vicar of Kirkham. On the 23rd of September in the ensuing
year, it was opened for worship, but remained unconsecrated until
the 4th of May, 1855. The church is dedicated to St. Nicholas.</p>

<p>The Rev. George Thistlethwaite was the son of the Rev. T.
Thistlethwaite, incumbent of St. George’s, Bolton-le-Moors, and
in 1837 officiated <i>pro. temp.</i> as head master of Kirkham Grammar
School. The Rev. S. E. Wentworth held the headmastership of
the same school from 1845 to 1860, as well as his curacy.</p>

<p>The free school of Ribby-with-Wrea owes its existence to the
frugality and benevolence of a tailor, named James Thistleton, of
Wrea, who, although his daily wages averaged no more than 4d.
and his food, managed, by great care and self-denial, to accumulate
a sufficient fund to establish a school at his native place, an object
to which he had in a great measure devoted his life. At his
death in 1693, it was found that, after a few small legacies, one
being “10s. to Mr. Clegg, vicar, to preach at my funeral,” and
another 6s. 8d. to each of the townships of Kirkham, Bryning,
and Westby, for the use of the poor, he had bequeathed the
remainder of his property “towards the making and maintaining
of a free school in the township of Ribby-cum-Wrea for ever,”
stipulating only that his surviving sister should receive annually
from the profits of his estate a sum of money sufficient for her
support during the rest of her life. The executors appointed
were Thomas Benson, Richard Shepherd, and Cuthbert Bradkirk,
whilst the money designed for the foundation of the school
amounted to £180.</p>

<p>The work thus commenced by Thistleton received, a few years
later, substantial assistance under the will, dated 10th September,
1716, of Nicholas Sharples, who is described as a “citizen and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_408"></a>[408]</span>
innholder of London.” The bequest in this instance amounted
to £850, and the two executors, Richard Wilson and Robert
Pigot, were directed, “with all convenient speed to apply such
sum of money towards the building or finishing of a school-house
for educating of boys and girls in Ribby-cum-Wrea,” and in the
purchase of land for the benefit of such establishment, and the
remuneration of the master, “for educating such a number of boys
and girls as nine of the most substantial men, chosen and elected
out of Ribby-cum-Wrea for governors or elders, or the major
part of them, shall think fit;” also that his name should be
inscribed in some prominent place on one of the school walls.<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p>

<p>In 1780 a girls’ school was established in a building separate
from that of the boys, but in 1847 the trustees of the foundation
gave the “materials of the boys’ school” and the plot of land as
a site for the new church, and in return the ecclesiastical party
erected, according to agreement, another school-house on a piece
of ground adjoining the girls’ school.<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<p>The area of the township amounts to 1,366 statute acres.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Westby, with Great and Little Plumptons.</span> Gilbert de
Clifton held the manor about 1280, and subsequently his son
William de Clifton was in possession about 1292. During the reign
of Edward III. John Fleetwood was lord of Little Plumpton,
and in 1394 his descendant, John Fleetwood, resided there. John
Talbot Clifton, esq., of Lytham Hall, whose ancestor was the
Gilbert de Clifton just mentioned, holds the manor of Westby
with Plumpton, by right of inheritance.</p>

<p>Bowen, the geographer, who wrote in 1717, alludes to a spa in
Plumpton, and states that it was impregnated with sulphur,
vitriol, ochre, iron, and a marine salt, united with a bitter purging
salt. The site of the spa has been lost in the lapse of time.</p>

<p>Westby Hall, the seat of the Cliftons, has been supplanted by a
farm-house. The old chapel connected with it was opened in
1742 to the Romanists of the district, but closed about a century
later. The present Catholic chapel was built in 1861. In 1849<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_409"></a>[409]</span>
a school, free to all denominations, was established by Thomas
Clifton, esq., of Lytham, but there seems to have been such an
institution existing before, as Ann Moor, of Westby, bequeathed,
in 1805, £40 to Plumpton school, and the interest of £20 to the
poor of Great Plumpton.</p>

<p>The area of the township is 3,426 statute acres.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Weeton-with-Preese.</span> On the arrival of the Normans
Weeton contained 300 acres of arable land. In the 9th year of
King John, Matilda, wife of Theobald Walter, obtained certain
inheritances in Weeton, Treales, and Rawcliffe. Theobald le
Botiler, or Butler, held Weeton in 1249; and in 1339, James,
son of Edmund le Botiler, earl of Ormond, had possession of it,
together with Treales, Little Marton, and Out Rawcliffe. The
manor descended in the same family until 1673, when it passed
to the 9th earl of Derby on his marriage with Elizabeth, daughter
of Thomas Butler, the Lord Ossory. The present earl of Derby
is now the lord of the soil, and holds a court baron by deputy.
There is a fair for cattle and small wares on the first Tuesday after
Trinity Sunday.</p>

<p>Preese is the Pres of Domesday Book, and comprised at that
time two carucates. Henry, duke of Lancaster, held Preese at his
death in 1361. In the reign of Henry VIII. the manor was in
the hands of the Skilicornes, who for many generations were the
coroners of Amounderness. Preese Hall, the ancient seat of this
family, was much damaged by a fire in 1732, which destroyed the
private chapel. In 1864 that portion of the mansion, which had
survived the conflagration and been repaired, was pulled down.
The site is now occupied by a farm-house, belonging to T. H.
Miller, esq., of Singleton, who owns a large amount of the land.</p>

<p>The church of Weeton is dedicated to St. Michael, and was
built in 1843 by subscription, to which the late earl of Derby
contributed generously. In 1852 the edifice was enlarged, and in
1861 the township of Weeton-with-Preese was united with the
Plumptons and Greenhalgh, to form an ecclesiastical parish. The
Rev. William Sutcliffe, when curate at Kirkham, performed the
duties at Weeton church, and was appointed incumbent there in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_410"></a>[410]</span>
1861. In 1862 he was succeeded by the present vicar, the Rev.
William Thorold. A National school was erected by subscription
and a grant from the National Society of £30, in 1845. A
Wesleyan chapel was built about 1827.</p>

<p>The area of the township is 2,876 statute acres.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Medlar-with-Wesham.</span> The abbot and brethren of Cockersand
Abbey became possessed of this township at an early date, and
retained it until the dissolution of monasteries, when the manor
of Medlar passed, by gift or purchase, to the Westbys, of
Mowbreck Hall. The estates of the Westbys were confiscated
by the Commonwealth, and only redeemed on the payment of
£1,000. The estate and Hall of Mowbreck are still held by
the same family.<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> The mansion preserves many evidences of its
great antiquity, including the old chapel and priests’ room.</p>

<p>Bradkirk, in Medlar, belonged to Theobald Walter in 1249, but
in the reign of Edward III. it was held by a family bearing the
name of Bradkirk, a title acquired from the estate. The Bradkirks
resided there as proprietors until somewhere about the opening of
the 17th century, when the earl of Derby had obtained the soil.
In 1723 Bradkirk was bought by John Richardson, of Preston,
from Thomas Stanley, of Cross Hall, in Ormskirk parish, who
held the manor by right of his wife Catherine, sister and heiress
of Christopher Parker, of Bradkirk, deceased, unmarried, a few
years before.<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> From John Richardson the manor passed successively
by will to William Richardson, Edward Hurst, of Preston,
and James Kearsley, of Over Hulton, by the last of whom it was
sold in 1797 to Joseph Hornby, esq., of Ribby, and his descendant,
H. H. Hornby, esq., of Ribby Hall, is the present holder. The
original Bradkirk Hall, the seat of the Bradkirks and Parkers, has
long since disappeared, and the edifice now bearing the name was
erected or rebuilt by Edward Hurst in 1764.</p>

<p>In 1864 an Independent Day and Sunday school was built by
Benjamin Whitworth, esq., M.P., of London, on land given by
R. C. Richards, esq., J.P., of Kirkham, and presented to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_411"></a>[411]</span>

Domesday Book to contain three carucates of soil. The township
was held by the Butlers of the Fylde at an early epoch, and
retained until 1626 at least, when Henry Butler, of Rawcliffe, was
lord of Greenhalgh and Thistleton. During the sovereignty of
Edward I. the abbot of Cockersand had certain rights there,
including assize of bread and beer.</p>

<p>Henry Colbourne, of London, bequeathed, in 1655, £5 10s. to
establish a school at Esprick in this township, but his wishes were
not properly carried out before 1679, at which date his legacy was
supplemented by gifts from 41 yeomen in the neighbourhood, and
a school erected to provide free education to the children of
Greenhalgh and Thistleton. Further endowments of £60 in
1766 from John Cooper, and £80 a little later by subscription,
were given to the institution; and in 1805 Mary Hankinson left
£200, and Richard Burch, of Greenhalgh, £200, to the same object.
The original school-house, formed of clay and thatched with
straw, has been pulled down, and a fresh one built. Subsequent
donations have been received under the wills of the Misses
Ellen and Hannah Dewhirst, the former of whom left £200,
in addition to a gift of £100 during her lifetime, and the latter
the residue of her estate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great and Little Singletons.</span> At the Domesday Survey,
Singletun contained six carucates of arable land, the lord of the
manor being Roger de Poictou, who gave the tithes at the close
of the eleventh century to the priory of St. Mary’s, Lancaster;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_412"></a>[412]</span>
this grant was subsequently confirmed by John, earl of Moreton.<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>
During the reigns of kings John and Henry III., Alan de Singleton
held a carucate of land in the township by serjeanty of the
wapentake of Amounderness.<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> In 20 Edward I. (1292) Thomas
de Singleton, a descendant of Alan, proved to the satisfaction
of a jury, when his right to certain offices was called in question,
that the manor of Little Singleton had belonged to his family
from time immemorial, and that the serjeanty of Amounderness
with its privileges and duties, was annexed and appurtenant to
that manor. Thomas de Singleton admitted, however, when
called upon by the king’s attorney to show by what title he held
the manors of Singleton, Thornton, and Brughton, the same
having been amongst the possessions of Richard I. at his death,
that he did not hold the whole of Singleton, as Thomas de Clifton
and Caterina his wife had one third of two bovates there; and
urged this fact as a plea why he could not be summoned to answer
the demand as made on behalf of Edward I. His objection was
allowed.<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> In 1297 Edmund, earl of Lancaster received annually
£21 from Singleton and 20s. from Singleton Grange. At the
opening of the fourteenth century Little Singleton had passed
into the hands of the Banastres, for the “hamlet of Singleton
Parva” was one of the estates of William Banastre at his death
in 17 Edward II. (1323-24).<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> Towards the end of the reign of
Edward II. Thomas, the son of the notorious Sir Adam Banastre,
held little Singleton and the serjeanty of Amounderness, and by
the latter of these had a right to the services of two bailiffs and a
boy to levy executions within the wapentake.<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

<p>The following notice of Singleton in the time of Henry, duke
of Lancaster, who died in 1361, occurs amongst the Lansdowne
manuscripts:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In Syngleton there are 21 messuages and 26 bovates of land held by bondsmen,
who pay annually at the feasts of Easter and St. Michael £21 9s. 3d. And there
are 11 cottages with so many inclosures, and one croft, and one piece of land in
the hands of tenants-at-will, paying annually 21s. 6d. All the aforesaid bondsmen
owe talliage, and give marchet and heriot,<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> and on the death of her husband
a widow gives one third part of his property to the lord of the manor, but more
is claimed in cases where the deceased happen to be widowers. And if any one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_413"></a>[413]</span>
possesses a male fowl it is forbidden to him to sell it without a license. The
duke of Lancaster owns the aforesaid tenements with right to hold a court. It is
to be noted that each of the above mentioned bovates of land is to pay at first
2s. 7d. per annum, with work at the plough and harrow, mowing meadows in
Ryggeby, and carrying elsewhere the lord’s provisions at Richmond, York,
Doncaster, Pontefract, and Newcastle, with 12 horses in Summer and Winter.
But afterwards the land was freed from this bondage, and paid per bovate
14s. 3d. ob.”</p>

</div>

<p>The lands of Thomas Banastre, before named, in “Syngleton
Parva, Ethelswyk, Frekulton, Hamylton, Stalmyn,” etc., were
escheated to John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster, in 1385, after the
death of Banastre.<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<p>Edmund Dudley, who was attainted in 1509 and afterwards
executed, held Little Singleton, as well as lands in Elswick,
Thornton, Wood Plumpton, Freckleton, etc.;<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> and in 1521
Thomas, earl of Derby, held the manor of Syngleton of
Henry VIII.<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<p>In the reign of James I. Great Singleton appears to have
belonged to the crown, for amongst a number of estates purchased
from the crown by Edward Badbie and William Weldon, of
London, for the sum of £2,000, is the “manor or lordship of
Singleton, alias Singleton Magna,” the annual rent of which is
stated to have been £16 17s. 0d. Subsequently the manor passed
to the Fanshaws, and from them to the Shaws; William Cunliffe
Shaw, of Preston, esq., sold it to Joseph Hornby, of Ribby Hall,
esq., and afterwards it was purchased by Thomas Miller, esq., of
Preston, who greatly improved the property by draining the low
lying lands known as Singleton Carrs, which in former days were
frequently in a state of partial or complete inundation. Thomas
H. Miller, esq., the present owner and eldest son of the late Thos.
Miller, esq., has recently erected a noble mansion on the estate,
where he resides during most of the year.</p>

<p>The earliest notice to be discovered of Singleton Grange is in
an old schedule of deeds, in which the land is mentioned
as having been granted by King John in 1215. In 1297, during
the reign of Edward I., Edmund Crouchback, earl of Lancaster,
received yearly the sum of 20s. from the estate. Subsequently the
Grange passed into the possession of the abbot and convent of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_414"></a>[414]</span>
Cockersand;<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> and at the dissolution of monasteries it became the
property of Henry VIII., who in 1543 granted it to William
Eccleston, of Eccleston, gentleman.<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> The Grange descended to
Thomas, the son, and afterwards to Adam, the grandson, of
William Eccleston. Adam Eccleston died sometime a little later
than 1597. The estate after his decease passed through several
hands in rapid succession, and in 1614 was sold by William
Ireland, gent., to William Leigh, B.D., clerk in holy orders and
rector of Standish. Theophilus Leigh, the eldest son of that
gentleman, resided at Singleton Grange, and married Clare,
daughter of Thomas Brooke, of Norton, Cheshire, by whom he
had one son, named William. William Leigh succeeded to the
Grange on the death of his father in 1658, and espoused Margaret,
daughter of Edward Chisenhall, of Chisenhall, Lancashire, and
had issue, Charles and Edward.</p>

<p>Charles Leigh, the elder of the two sons, became celebrated as
a physician and student of natural history and antiquities. He
was born at the Grange in 1662, and at the age of 21 graduated
as B.A. at the University of Oxford; afterwards he removed to
Cambridge to study medicine, and in 1690 obtained the degree of
M.D. In 1685 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.
He married Dorothy, daughter of Edward Shuttleworth, of
Larbrick, and practised as a physician both in London and in the
neighbourhood of his birthplace, on one occasion, according to his
own version, performing a wonderful cure on Alexander Rigby,
of Layton Hall. His published works were—<i>Physiologia Lancastriensis</i>,
in 1691, and the <i>Natural History of Lancashire,
Cheshire, and the Peak of Derbyshire, with an account of the
British, Phœnician, Armenian, Greek, and Roman Antiquities in
those parts</i>, in 1700, of which latter Dr. Whittaker remarks:—“Had
this doctor filled his whole book, as he has done nearly
one-half of it, with medical cases, it might have been of some
use; but how, with all possible allowances for the blindness
and self-partiality of human nature, a man should have thought
himself qualified to write and to publish critical remarks on a
subject of which he understood not the elementary principles,
it is really difficult to conceive.”<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_415"></a>[415]</span></p>

<p>Somewhere before the commencement of the eighteenth
century, the estate of Bankfield was separated from the Grange,
which, during the latter portion, at least, of the lifetime of Dr.
Leigh, who died shortly after the publication of his “Natural
History,” was held by a person named Joseph Green. In 1701
the executors of Joseph Green sold a portion of Singleton
Grange to Richard Harrison, of Bankfield, yeoman. The
remainder of the Grange land was held by widow Green until
her death, when it passed by her will, dated 1716, to her two
sons, Richard and Paul Green.<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>

<p>Richard Harrison, of Bankfield, obtained the whole of Singleton
Grange in 1738, and left it on his decease to his son Richard,
from whom it descended about 1836 to his only surviving child,
Agnes Elizabeth, the wife of Edwards Atkinson, of Fleetwood,
justice of the peace for the county of Lancaster. Mrs. Atkinson
died childless in 1850, and bequeathed Singleton Grange to her
husband, who in his turn entailed the estate upon his eldest son,
Charles Edward Dyson Atkinson, still a minor, the offspring of a
second marriage, with Anne, daughter of Christopher Thornton
Clark, of Cross Hall, Lancashire, by whom he had issue two sons
and a daughter,—Ann Elizabeth Ynocensia, John Henry Gladstone,
and the present heir. The old Hall of Singleton Grange
has been modernised and converted into a farm-house.</p>

<p>It is very probable that there was a chapel in Singleton
during the earlier years of the fourteenth century, for in
1358-59, Henry, duke of Lancaster, granted to John de Estwitton,
hermit, the custody of the chapel of St. Mary, in Singleton;
and in 1440 a license was granted to celebrate mass to the
inhabitants of Singleton in the chapel at the same place for
one year. Twelve years afterwards another license was granted
by the archdeacon of Richmond for an oratory to be established
in the chapel for the use of the people of the township;
and in 1456 the license was renewed by archdeacon Laurence
Bothe to John Skilicorne, of Kirkham. The chapel, with
all its appurtenances, passed to the Crown at the Reformation;
and in the report of the Commissioners of Edward VI., it is
stated that “A Stipendarye is founded in the Chapelle of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_416"></a>[416]</span>
Syngleton, in Kirkeham, by vertue of a lease made out of the
Duchie to Sʳ Richarde Houghton, knight, the 26th day of
Februarie, in the ffirst yere of the raigne of our soveraign
lorde the kinge, that nowe is (1547), unto the ende of 21 yeres
the next following; wherein the said Sʳ Richarde covenanteth
to pay yerely duringe the said time to a Pryest celebrating
in the said Chapelle the sum of 49s. The said Chapelle is distant
from the parishe Church of Kirkeham 4 myles; Richarde Godson,
the Incumbent, of the age of 38 yeres, hath the said yerely salarie
of 49s.” Thomas Houghton, of Lea, the son of the knight,
appears to have had some difficulty in inducing sundry of the
Singleton tenants to recognise his right of proprietorship after
the death of his father, for we find him pleading in the duchy
court in 1560-61 that he held the “lands of the late kynge in
Singleton, also a house called the chapell house, with three
acres of land in the tenure of Wᵐ Yede, a chapell called Singleton
chapell, in Singleton aforesaid, with the chapell yarde thereunto
belonging, one house or cottage called Corner-rawe, and a windmill;
and that the tenants thereof, Robert Carter and James
Hall, had never paid any rent, and refused to do so.”<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p>

<p>In 1562 the Charity Commissioners of Edward VI. founded a
“stipendarye in the Chapelle of Syngleton in Kyrkeham.”</p>

<p>At the archiepiscopal visitation of the diocese of Chester in
1578, the following list of charges was brought against the curate
of Singleton:—“There is not servyse done in due tyme—He
kepeth no hous nor releveth the poore—He is not dyligent in
visitinge the sycke—He doth not teach the catechisme—There is
no sermons—He churcheth fornycatours without doinge any
penaunce—He maketh a donge hill of the chapel yeard, and he
hath lately kepte a typlinge hous and a nowty woman in it.”<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p>

<p>From that time we hear no more of the old chapel of Singleton,
but the chapel-house, alluded to above, was at a later period
flourishing as an inn, and bearing the same name; at the
Oliverian survey, in 1650, it was stated that there was a newly
erected chapel at Singleton, but that it had no endowment or
maintenance belonging to it, and that the inhabitants prayed that
it might be constituted a parish church with a “minister and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_417"></a>[417]</span>
competent mayntenance allowed.”<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> It is probable that after
the decline of the Commonwealth this chapel fell into the
hands of the Catholics, for Thomas Tyldesley, of Fox Hall,
a Romanist, in his diary of 1712, 13 and 14, speaks several times
of going “to Great Singleton to prayers”; and doubtless it is
the one alluded to in the following indenture, bearing the date
29th August, 1749:—“William Shaw, esq., lord of the manor of
Shingleton in yᵉ parish of Kirkham, gave a chapel belonging
to him at Shingleton aforesaid, then used as a popish chapel, to
be used for yᵉ future as a chapel of ease to yᵉ mother church of
Kirkham, for yᵉ benefit of yᵉ inhabitants of Shingleton and of the
adjacent townships; and that the said Wᵐ. Shaw proposed to give
£200, to be added to a similar sum from Queen Anne’s bounty,
for yᵉ endowment of yᵉ said chapel, in consideration whereof
Samuel, lord bishop of Chester as ordinary, the dean and chapter
of Christ Church, Oxford, as patrons, and Chas. Buck as incumbent,
by virtue of an act of George I., grant and decree that yᵉ said
William Shaw and his heirs and assigns for ever shall have yᵉ
nomination to and patronage of yᵉ said chapel, as often as it is
vacant.”</p>

<p>This chapel was dedicated to St. Anne, and in 1756 it was
agreed “by all parties that the chapel of Singleton should be
always considered a place of public worship according to the
liturgy of the Church of England, and the chapel yard always
appropriated to the burying of the dead and the support of the
minister”; further, the chapel living was declared a perpetual
curacy, separate and independent of the mother church of
Kirkham, “save and except that the curate must assist the vicar
of the latter place on Christmas day, Easter day, Whitsunday,
Good Friday, and each sabbath when it is customary to administer
the sacrament; also the tythes, Easter dues, funeral sermons, and
all other parochial rights and duties belonged to the vicarage of
Kirkham.”<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p>

<p>The above is an authentic record of the way in which the
chapel of Singleton passed out of the hands of the Romanists into
those of the Protestants, but the Rev. W. Thornber, to whom
this document was evidently unknown, has given in his <i>History<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_418"></a>[418]</span>
of Blackpool and its neighbourhood</i>, a different version of the
matter. He states, with apparently no greater authority than
tradition, that after the suppression of the rebellion of 1745, the
protestants of the village celebrated the 5th of November more
zealously than usual, raising contributions of peat at every house,
and amongst the rest had even the presumption to call at that of
the priest. The refusal of the ecclesiastic to provide his share of
fuel so incensed the villagers that they ejected him both from his
house and the church; and the lord of the manor seized this
opportunity to convert the chapel into a protestant place of worship.</p>

<p>Singleton chapel was a low building with a thatched roof, the
eaves of which came within a short distance of the ground; the
priest’s house was attached to the chapel and communicated with
it by a door into the sacristy. In 1806 this ancient building,
having become much dilapidated, was pulled down and replaced,
through the liberality of Joseph Hornby, of Ribby, esq., by a neat
gothic structure, having a square tower at one end, in which was
placed a peal of six bells; in 1859 the latter edifice was levelled to
the ground, and the present handsome and commodious church
erected on the site, chiefly through the munificence of the late
Thomas Miller, esq. The few mural monuments within the
church are not of any great antiquity, and are <i>in memoriam</i> of
the Harrisons and Atkinsons, of Bankfield. There are no inscriptions
of interest in the churchyard, beyond those on the stones
surmounting the vault belonging to the Bankfield families just
named. In 1869 a separate district or parish was assigned to this
cure, and the present incumbent of the church acquired the title
of vicar.</p>

<p>The Rev. Cuthbert Harrison was the son of Richard Harrison,
of Newton, in Kirkham parish, and appears to have been the
progenitor of the Harrisons, of Bankfield, being the first of the
name on record as holder of that property. It is doubtful
whether this minister was ejected from Singleton, as generally
believed, or not, for in 1662, the date of the Act of Uniformity
which drove so many of the clergy from their cures, he was in
Ireland, holding the office of minister at Shankel, near Lurgan;
so that if his ejection ever did take place from Singleton it must
have been anterior to, and consequently unconnected with, the
obnoxious Act. According to a letter from his son, however, he
was ejected from Shankel, and it is probably that circumstance
which has given rise to the supposition and assertion that he was
one of those who suffered in the Fylde for conscience’s sake in 1662.
After leaving Ireland he opened a meeting-house at Elswick in
1672 by royal license, for the use “of such as do not conform to
the Church of England and are of the persuasion commonly
called Congregational.” This place of worship was closed shortly
afterwards by a decree of parliament, and Cuthbert Harrison, to
escape persecution, was compelled to hold his services “very
privately in the night” in his own house, or in one belonging to
some member of his congregation. “He practysed physic,” says
his son, “with good success, and by it supported his family and
gained the favour of the neighbouring gentry. He baptized his
own children, with many others.”</p>

<p>Vicar Clegg, of Kirkham, seems to have grown very wrathful
at what he doubtless regarded as the presumption of Cuthbert
Harrison, in taking upon himself the right to baptize children and
solemnize matrimony, and presented him before the ecclesiastical
court on a charge of “marrying one James Benson, of Warles, and
baptizing a child of his.” The inquiry resulted in both Harrison
and Benson being excommunicated; but the former was not
deterred by this ban from repairing to the church of Kirkham,
much to the indignation of Mr. Clegg, who on one occasion was
so much disturbed on seeing the irrepressible excommunicant in
the chancel, whilst he engaged with the sermon, that he lost the
thread of his discourse, and being unable to find the place
amongst his notes, “was silent for some time.” Smarting under
the additional annoyance the vicar ordered the churchwardens to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_420"></a>[420]</span>
eject Mr. Harrison from the building at once, but that gentleman
refused to leave unless Mr. Clegg in person performed the duty of
turning him out; incensed at his show of obstinacy, the vicar
appealed to Christopher Parker, esq., of Bradkirk Hall, a justice
of the peace, who was seated within six feet of Mr. Harrison, to
remove him, but the magistrate refused to act in the matter, and
Mr. Clegg was obliged to descend from the pulpit and undertake
the unpleasant task himself. He walked up to the offender, and,
taking him by the sleeve, desired him to go out from the church;
Mr. Harrison went peaceably with the vicar, but had no sooner
passed out through the chancel door than he exclaimed in a loud
voice “It is time to go when the devil drives.”</p>

<p>Shortly after this episode Mr. Clegg sued Cuthbert Harrison for
the sum of 120s., being a fine of 20s. per month extending over
six months, for non-attendance at the parish church. The
defendant pleaded that when he had attempted to attend the
service at Kirkham he had been ejected from the church by the
plaintiff himself, and the judge who summed up the evidence in
favour of the defendant, remarked—“There is fiddle to be hanged
and fiddle not to be hanged.” The verdict went against Mr.
Clegg, who reaped only the payment of his own and defendant’s
costs from this piece of persecution.</p>

<p>Cuthbert Harrison died in 1681, and “a great entreaty,” writes
his son, “was made to Mr. Clegg to suffer his body to be buried
in the church; he-was prevailed with, and Mr. Harrison was
interred a little within the great door, which has since been the
burial place of the family.” The first epitaph below is said, by
his son, to have been fixed upon “Cuth. Harrison’s grave by Mr.
Clegg”; the second one is a retaliation, reported to have been
substituted by some local rhymester, after effacing the original
one:—</p>

<p>In 1768 another chapel was erected by the Romanists at
Singleton by subscription, and almost immediately the officiating<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_421"></a>[421]</span>
priest, the Rev. Father Watts, renounced his creed, publicly
recanting at Kirkham; he died in 1773, when minister at the
episcopal chapel of Wrea-green. According to Mr. Thornber, the
priests of Singleton could seldom assign a better reason for
desiring a removal to another sphere of labour, than that they
were surfeited with wild ducks from the “carrs.” The chapel was
rebuilt subsequently, but closed when the present one at Poulton
had been completed and opened a few years.</p>

<p>Mains or Maynes Hall is situated in the manor of Little
Singleton, and appears on ancient maps as Monk’s Hall. The
original Hall was built in the form of a quadrangle, the chapel
being on the right and the kitchen on the left; the latter, taken
down rather more than half a century ago, was roofed with tiles,
about six inches square, piled thickly upon one another, and
contained several secret recesses or hiding places, one of which
was situated near the mantel-piece, and another, entered from the
floor above by means of a ladder, showed manifest evidences of
having been occupied. The present Hall is less antique in its
construction and arrangements than its predecessor. In 1745 a
party of Scotch rebels feasted there; and George IV., when
Prince of Wales, is said to have been an occasional visitor at the
mansion. The mantel-piece of the drawing-room was formerly
adorned with a family painting of the Howards, dukes of Norfolk;
and adjoining that spacious apartment is a small room, which
appears to have been an oratory, containing relics of distinguished
saints. The outside wall of the old chapel bears the date 1686,
and within are a gilded altar in a state of dilapidation, a large
picture of the ‘Virgin and Infant,’ a coat of arms, and various
scraps of scriptural texts and ordinances of the church of Rome.<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

<p>Cardinal Allen, of Rossall Hall, the brother-in-law of William
Hesketh, who was living at Mains Hall at the opening of the
seventeenth century, is said to have frequently secreted himself
in the hiding places there, during the time he was engaged in
endeavouring to alienate the loyalty of the catholics of this
district, and induce them to assist the invasion of Philip of Spain,
whose forces were expected to land at Peel in Morecambe Bay.</p>

<p>The Heskeths were the first tenants of Mains Hall of whom we
have any notice, and the above William was the first of the family<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_422"></a>[422]</span>
to reside there; a full account of the descent and intermarriages
of the Heskeths of Mains will be found in the chapter on ancient
families of the Fylde.</p>

<p>The Hall and estate are now the property of Thomas Fitzherbert
Brockholes, of Claughton, esq.</p>

that Adam de Eccleston and William de Molines, with three others,
had part of a knight’s fee in Eccleston and Larbrick, about 1300.
In 1500 Richard Kerston had 60 acres in Little Eccleston, a
portion of which passed on his death in 1546 to John ffrance, who
had married one of his daughters. The ffrances retained their
possessions until 1817, when they were bequeathed by the last of
the line to Thomas Wilson, of Preston, who adopted their surname.<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>
Larbrick was held in 1336 by William de Coucy, of
Gynes, but in 1358 it belonged to Sir William Molyneux, of
Sefton, in whose family it remained until about 1601, at which
date William Burgh, of Burgh, near Chorley, died, holding it.
Subsequently the manor passed, through the daughter of
William Burgh, to Edward Shuttleworth, of Thornton Hall,
who had espoused her grand-daughter. The last proprietor
here named died in 1673, and the estate was divided, a
moiety going to Dr. Charles Leigh, who had married one of
his two daughters and co-heiresses, and the second mediety
to Richard Longworth, who was the husband of the other. Dr.
Leigh mortgaged his share, which eventually was obtained by
Richard Harrison, of Bankfield; whilst that of Richard Longworth,
passed, about 1700, to the Hornbys, of Poulton, and afterwards
to the Pedders, of Preston, who held it for more than a
century. Mr. Whiteside, who purchased it from the Rev. Jno.
Pedder, is now owner. Larbrick Hall, for long a seat of the
noble house of Molyneux, is at present represented by a farm-house.

Kirkham, in 1688, set up a scandalous trough for a font in Lund
chapel; and 4 sackfuls of moss he then carried from the church
to repair the said chapel, and so it first began to be repaired at
the parish charge.” The old chapel was pulled down in 1824,
and a stone church erected. In 1852 a chancel was added, and
more recently a tower. Lund and Newton-with-Scales were
constituted an ecclesiastical parish in 1840. The church is
dedicated to St. John, and the dean and chapter of Christ
Church, Oxford, are the patrons.</p>

50s. being for the vicar, and the surplus for the poor. The school
was established about 1682, by a legacy of £60 left by John
Dickson, half the interest to go to the minister of Lund chapel,
providing he belonged to the Church of England, and the other
moiety to the master of the school. The interest of £10, origin
unknown, is paid each year to the trustees of the school.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treales, Roseacre, and Wharles.</span> The ancient manor of
Treales embraced the three estates of Treales, Roseacre, and
Wharles, being computed in the Domesday Book to contain two
carucates of arable soil. In 1207 Treales was granted to Robert
de Vavassour, the father-in-law of Theobald Walter, and subsequently
it descended in the Butler family until 1673, when the
9th earl of Derby acquired it with his wife, the daughter of
Thomas Butler, the lord Ossory. The present earl of Derby is
lord of the manor, and holds a court annually.</p>

<p>The church, a plain stone building with nave and chancel only,
was erected in 1853, and endowed five years later by the dean and
chapter of Christ Church, Oxford. The Rev. J. Hodgkin is the
incumbent.</p>

<p>William Grimbaldson, M.D., left £300 in 1725, the interest to
be used for binding out poor apprentices in Treales, whose parents
received no parish relief. Boulton’s and Porter’s charities are
rentals amounting to about £12 a-year, to be given to poor
persons of the township. Bridgett’s charity is the interest of £15
for the poor of Wharles.</p>

<p>The area of the township is 1,525 statute acres.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hambleton.</span> Hambleton was held during the reign of King
John by Geoffrey, the Crossbowman, or de Hackensall, from
whom it descended to his son-in-law Richard de Sherburne, and
afterwards to Robert de Sherburne, the son of the latter. The
manor was held successively by different members of the
Sherburne family until 1363, when it passed to Richard de
Bailey, who had married the daughter and heiress of the last
male Sherburne, and adopted the maiden surname of his wife.
Hence the title of the manorial lords remained unchanged
up to 1717, when the property became the possession of the
Duchess of Ormond, the sole child of Sir Nicholas Sherburne,
who died at that date. After the decease of the Duchess of
Ormond, without issue, Hambleton passed to Edward, the son of
William Weld, of Lulworth Castle, by his marriage with the
sister of Sir Nicholas Sherburne. The descendants of Edward
Weld still retain some portion of the soil, but a considerable
proportion has been sold in recent years.</p>

<p>Bishop Gastrell affirms that the episcopal chapel of Hambleton
was consecrated in 1567. In 1650 the Parliamentary Commissioners
reported:—“There is no allowance to the minister, but
only £5 per an. payd by Richard Sherburne, esq., lord of the
manor, and £40 per an. by order from the committee for
plundered ministers. The inhabitants desire it may be made a
parish, and the township of Rawcliffe, lying within a myle of it
and four miles from their parish church, may be annexed to it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_426"></a>[426]</span></p>

<p>The present church was erected in 1749, and is a plain whitewashed
building, without a tower or any attempt at architectural
display. Attached to the south wall within are three tablets
inscribed thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Beneath this marble are deposited the remains of Mary Ramsden, daughter
and heiress of the rev. Christʳ. Westby Alderston, late vicar of St. Michael’s in
this county, and wife of Rowland Ramsden of Halifax. She was born Aug. 17ᵗʰ,
1768 and died Nov. 6ᵗʰ, 1764.”</p>

<p>“Sacred to the memory of George Bickerstaffe of Hambleton, gent., died May
3ʳᵈ, 1766; Jenny Alderston, his granddaughter, died May 16ᵗʰ, 1770; and Agnes,
wife of the rev. Christʳ. Westby Alderston, widow of Richᵈ. Harrison of Bankfield,
and daughter of George Bickerstaffe, died March 14ᵗʰ, 1820.”</p>

<p>“Sacred to the memory of the rev. Thomas Butcher, B.A., for 39 years the
respected incumbent of this chapel. Erected by the voluntary contributions of
his parishioners.”</p>

</div>

<p>On the aisles of the church are three gravestones, bearing the
following inscriptions:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In this aisle lie the remains of the rev. John Field, B.A. and minister of this
place, who died 21st April, 1765; also his wife and children.”</p>

<p>“Here lies the body of Dorothy, wife of Richard Carter of Hambleton, who
died 14th May, 1807.”</p>

<p>“William, son of James Norris of Liverpool, buried the 29th of June 1692—Though
Boreas’ Blast and Neptune’s Waves have tost me to and fro, yet a spite
on both by God’s decree I harbour here below: Here at anchor I doe ride with
many of our fleet, yet once again I must set sail my Generall Christ to meet.”<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In earlier days, when the church was held by the Roman
Catholics, the burial ground was evidently of much greater extent
than at present, and surrounded by an immense moat, between
six and seven yards wide, and of a considerable depth. In a field
lying to the east of the church can now be seen the ancient limits
of the ground in that direction, bounded by a long stretch of the
old moat in a very fair state of preservation, but of course somewhat
contracted by accumulations of vegetation; and in another
plot of ground to the west, may be traced by a slight depression
the course of the same trench, marking the westerly extent of the
yard. The northerly length of the moat passed behind the
present churchyard, and a portion of it, about two yards wide, is
still to be seen there, the remainder of its breadth being filled in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_427"></a>[427]</span>
and included in the cemetery. The southerly stretch of this
ancient ditch or fosse ran just within the railings, protecting the
burial ground in front. When the existing walls were built
round the yard great difficulty was met with in forming a good
foundation over the site of the moat at different points, as it was
found to be filled in with fragments of bricks, mortar, and general
rubbish, which seems to indicate that it was abolished when the
church itself was in course of reconstruction, and that the old
building materials and <i>debris</i> were used for the purpose of raising
it to the common level, indicating that the work must have
been accomplished either at the rebuilding of 1749, or at some
previous and unrecorded one. The moat would be crossed by a
bridge of fair dimensions, which was probably situated on the
west side, as the sexton lately discovered the well-preserved
remains of a straight footpath, paved with long tiles, and
running from the church for some distance towards the site of
the moat in that direction; the path was between two and
three feet below the surface of the ground.</p>

<p>The church was separated from the mother edifice of Kirkham,
and had an independent district assigned to it in 1846. The
incumbent has the title of vicar.</p>

<p>An Independent chapel was erected by subscription a few years
since, and schools subsequently added.</p>

<p>From the report of the Charity Commissioners, we learn that
long before the commencement of the nineteenth century there
was a school at Hambleton, but no attempt to elucidate more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_428"></a>[428]</span>
particularly its origin or date of erection can be hazarded. In
1797 the only endowment it can boast of was left by Matthew
Lewtas, a native of Hambleton, and consisted of £200, the
interest of which had to be given to John, the son of
George Hall, of Hambleton, until he reached the age of
twenty-one; and if before or at that time he was appointed
master of the school he had to continue to receive the whole
of the income whilst he held such mastership, but if, although
he was willing to accept the post, some other person should
be selected for it, then when he came of age, half of the income
passed from him to the school, and he retained the other
moiety until his death, when it also went to increase the stipend
of the master. The other condition of the will applied to the
master, and obliged him in return for the interest or income of
the £200, to teach as many poor children of Hambleton as the
money would pay for. John Hall never obtained the appointment,
so that the present master receives the full interest of the bequest,
which is invested on mortgage.</p>

<p>The poor of Hambleton have £2 annually distributed amongst
them through the generosity of Sir Nicholas Sherburne, of
Stonyhurst, who in 1706, when lord of the manor of Hambleton,
charged his estate of Lentworth Hall with this charity.</p>

<p>The yearly interest of £10 was given for the benefit of poor
housekeepers in Hambleton by Mary, the daughter of vicar Clegg,
of Kirkham, and the wife of Emanuel Nightingale, of York, gent.,
who was born in 1673.</p>

<p class="dropcap">At the commencement of the Norman dynasty, when
William I. instituted a survey of his newly-conquered
territory, the name of the town and parish which
will occupy our attention throughout the present
chapter was written <i>Lidun</i>, and was estimated to contain two
carucates of arable land. How long this orthography continued
in use is difficult to say, but it could not have been for much more
than a century, as amongst certain legal documents in the reign
of King John, the locality is referred to under the style of <i>Lethum</i>,
an appellation which seems to have adhered to it until comparatively
recent years. The derivation of the latter title is apparently
from the Anglo-Saxon word <i>lethe</i>, signifying a barn, and points
obviously to an agricultural origin, whilst the more antique name
of <i>Lidun</i> is possibly a corruption of the Anglo-Saxon <i>lade</i>,
implying a river discharging itself into the sea, that is, its mouth
or estuary, and <i>tun</i>, a town.</p>

<p>Shortly before the termination of the reign of Richard I. in
1199, Richard Fitz Roger, who is supposed to have belonged to
the Banastre family, gave all his lands in Lethum, with the
church of the same vill, and all things belonging to the church,
to God, and the monks of Durham, that they might establish a
Benedictine cell there to the honour of St. Mary and St. Cuthbert.<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>
The following is a copy of the document by which the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_430"></a>[430]</span>
transfer was effected:—“Richard Fitz Roger, to all men, both
French and English, who may see this letter, greeting: Let all
and each of you know, that I, with the consent and wish of my
wife, Margaret, and my heirs, for the Salvation of my lord, Earl
John, and for the souls of my Father and Mother, and mine and
my heirs, have given and granted, and with these presents confirm
as a pure and perpetual offering to God and the Blessed
Mary and St. Cuthbert, and the monks of Durham, all my estate
of Lethum, with the church at the same vill, with all things
appertaining to it, in order to build a house of their own order;
namely, within these divisions—From the ditch on the western
side of the cemetery of Kilgrimol (Lytham Common) over which
I have erected a Cross, and from the same ditch and Cross eastward,
going along the Curridmere (Wild Moss or Tarns) beyond
the Great Moss, and the brook, as far as Balholme (Ballam), which
brook runs towards Snincbrigg (Sluice Bridge). Likewise from
Balholme directly across the moss, which my lord John, earl of
Moreton, divided between himself and me, as far as the
northern part of Estholmker (Estham), going eastward as far as
the division of the water which comes from Birckholme (Birks),
and divides Etholmker and Brimaker (Bryning), following this
division of water southward as far as the middle point between
Etholme and Coulurugh (Kellamergh), and thus returning
towards the west and going southward across the Moss as far as
la Pull from the other side of Snartsalte (Saltcoats), as it falls
upon the sand of the sea, and thus going southward across to
Ribril to the waterside, and thus following the line of the water
to the sea on the west, and so to the ditch and across aforementioned,”
etc., etc. In a charter dated 1200-1, it is specified that
the whole of the lands of Lytham, amounting to two carucates,
had been presented by King John when earl of Moreton, to
Richard Fitz Roger, by whom, as just shown, they were immediately
conveyed to the monks of Durham.</p>

<p>There are unfortunately no means of ascertaining the extent or
appearance of the Benedictine cell established at Lytham, but its
site would seem to have been that now occupied by Lytham Hall,
in the walls of some of the offices attached to which remains of
the ancient monastic edifice have been incorporated. Dr. Kuerden
alludes, in a manuscript preserved in the Chetham library, to an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_431"></a>[431]</span>
undated claim of feudal privileges in Lytham, by which the prior
of Durham asserted his right to have view of frankpledge in his
manor of Lytham, with waif, stray, and infangthefe<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a>; emendations
of the assize of bread and beer; wrecks of the sea; exemption for
himself and tenants in Lytham from suit to the county and
wapentake, and from fines and penalties; to have soc, sac, and
theam;<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> and finally, to have free warren over all his lands in
Lytham, and all royal fish taken there. During the reign of
Edward I. the legality of the ecclesiastic’s assumption of the sole
right to wreckage was called in question, ultimately ending in
litigation, and at Trinity Term, York, the verdict of the jury was
given against him. In the twenty-third year of his sovereignty,
Edward I. granted the wreck, waif, and stray of Lytham to his
brother Edmund, the earl of Lancaster. Amongst the Rolls of
the Duchy is the record of an agreement, entered into in 1271,
between Ranulphus de Daker, sheriff of Lancaster, Richard le
Botiler, and others, for arranging and fixing, with the consent and
approval of Stephen, the prior of Lytham, the boundaries between
the land of Lytham and Kilgrimol, and that of Layton. The
priors of Lytham were entirely dependent on the parent house
until 1443, when they solicited and induced Pope Eugenius to
issue an edict declaring the prior of that date and his successors
perpetual in their office and no longer removable at the will and
dictation of the monks of Durham. Afterwards, in the same year,
letters patent were received at the Lytham cell, pardoning the
application to the papal See and granting the request;<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> but the
union between the two houses was not absolutely dissolved, for we
find that, in addition to the various properties at Lytham and
Durham continuing to be valued together, the cell and domain
of the former place were granted in 2 Mary, 1554, to Sir Thomas
Holcroft as part of the possessions of the Durham convent. In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_432"></a>[432]</span>
1606 the knight transferred his rights and lands in Lytham to
Sir Cuthbert Clifton, in exchange for certain estates on the
opposite side of the river Ribble. John Talbot Clifton, esq., of
Lytham Hall, a descendant of the latter gentleman, is the present
lord of the manor. Reverting to the Benedictine cell it is seen
from an ecclesiastical valuation, taken in the reign of Henry VIII.,
probably about the time of the Reformation, that the annual
income of the institution was derived from the following sources:—</p>

<p>It is evident from the wording of the foundation-charter of the
cell of Lytham that a church existed there at that date, and
Reginald of Durham affirms that the grand-father of Richard
Fitz Roger pulled down the original church of Lytham, which
had been built of shingle, and erected another of stone, dedicating
it to St. Cuthbert.<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> This event must have taken place anterior to
the establishment of the Benedictines in the locality, and is possibly
related by the Durham ecclesiastic as a brief account of the stone
church standing there when the grant of lands, etc., was made to
his monastery by Fitz Roger. Amongst the number of historical
fragments collected by Gregson is a notice to the effect that
Thomas de Thweng was rector of the church of Lytham in
22 Edward III. (1349), and founded a chantry of twelve in the
parish church “to pray for the good estate of himself and Henry,
Lord Perci, and for the souls of their ancestors.” Thomas de
Thweng was descended from Lucy, granddaughter of Helewise,
the eldest sister of William de Lancaster, and in 1374, very likely
the year of his death, held the manor of Garstang.<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> The edifice
existing until 1770, when another church, also dedicated to
St. Cuthbert, was erected on its site, was a low building, constructed
of cobble stones, the walls being more than a yard in
thickness and penetrated by five windows, one of which was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_433"></a>[433]</span>
situated at the east end, and the others at the sides. The main
entrance was protected by a porch. From the scanty description
preserved of the general features of this antique specimen of
ecclesiastical architecture, it has been conjectured that its origin
might be traced back to the time of Henry VIII. Within the
erection the seats, which were of black oak, ornamented with
scrolls, were arranged in four rows, two running down the centre
and one down each side, whilst the north side of a small chancel
was set apart for the choristers. The pulpit was fixed against the
south wall; and the Cliftons possessed an old canopied seat, the
precise station of which cannot be ascertained.</p>

<p>On the demolition of this church in 1770, its successor arose
with a somewhat more pretentious exterior, having a low tower
abutting the west extremity. The interior of the latter structure
contained several objects of interest, amongst which may be
noticed two tables fastened to the wall and inscribed as under:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

</div>

<p>On each side of the altar, at the east end of the church, were
several mural marble monuments erected in memory of certain
members of the Clifton family, whose remains had been interred
within the walls of the sacred edifice. Thomas Clifton was the
first of this family buried at Lytham, and on his tomb was inscribed:—“Here
lie interred the mortal remains of Thomas Clifton, of
Lytham, esquire; who died on the 16th of Dec., 1784, in the 38th
year of his age. Requiescat in pace.”</p>

<p>Another monument, near to the former one, bore the following
inscription:—“D.O.M. Here lies dead the body of Ann Clifton,
wife of Thomas Clifton, of Lytham, esq.; daughter of Sir Carnaby
Haggerstone, Baronet: but her name will live to future ages.
Wonder not, reader; in her was seen whatever is amiable in a
daughter, wife, mother, friend, and Christian. Admire her, man;
a pattern to her sex. O! woman, imitate. She died in the 37th
year of her age, on the 22nd day of February, 1760. Requiescat
in pace.”</p>

<p>The memorial writing over a third tomb ran thus:—“Here lies
the body of Thomas Clifton, of Lytham, esq.; who departed this
life in the 56th year of his age, on the 11th day of May, 1783.
R.I.P.;” whilst a fourth monument had these lines upon it:—“Here
lies the body of Jane Clifton, wife of Thomas Clifton, of
Lytham, Esq.; daughter of the Right Hon. the Earl of Abingdon,
who departed this life in the 61st year of her age, on the 14th
day of Feb., 1791. R.I.P.”</p>

<p>A white marble tablet fixed against the south wall, contained
the annexed notice:—“In memory of Elizabeth Clifton, wife of
John Clifton, of Lytham, Esq.; and daughter of Thomas Horsley
Widdrington Riddell, of Swinburne Castle, in the county of
Northumberland, esq.; who departed this life in the 63rd year of
her age, on the 19th day of November, 1825. Requiescat in
pace.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_435"></a>[435]</span></p>

<p>Sixty-four years from the date of its erection this church was
also pulled down, having become unable to accommodate the
increasing influxes of visitors during the summer; and on the
20th of March, 1834, the foundation stone of the existing pile
was laid by the late Thomas Clifton, esq., of Lytham Hall, who
contributed £500 towards the cost of the building. Mrs. Fisher,
the widow of a local physician, contributed £300, and the
subscriptions for the necessary work were further augmented by
a grant from the Church Building and Extension Society. The
church, which comprises nave, side aisles, chancel, and embattled
tower, contains the monuments of the Cliftons already enumerated,
and three additional marbles, one of which, at the entrance to the
chancel, records that “in the family vault near this place lies the
body of Hetty, daughter of Pelegrine Treves, esq., and widow of
the late Thomas Clifton, esq., of Clifton and Lytham; she died
on the 4th of June, 1864, aged 68 years.” The other attached to
the opposite side of the entrance is <i>in memoriam</i> of “Thomas
Clifton (eldest son of John Clifton, esq., by Elizabeth, his wife) of
Clifton and Lytham, who died 17th February, 1851, aged 63
years”; whilst the third, in the chancel itself, is to the memory
of “John Clifton, of Lytham, esq., who departed this life on the
25th of March, 1832, aged 68 years. Requiescat in Pace.”
Against the wall of the south side aisle is a tablet surmounted
by a cross and inscribed thus:—“In memory of Richard Barton
Robinson, born July 28: A: D: 1804, died August 9: A: D:
1872, vicar of Lytham for 36 years. This cross is gratefully
erected by his parishioners, A.D. 1875.” A similar tablet in the
north aisle is erected to the “memory of Edward and Sarah Jane
Houghton, by their only surviving son. E. H. born April 23:
1807: died December 15: 1869. S. J. H. born September 26:
1803: died April 21: 1872.” The east window, beautifully
emblazoned, “is dedicated by her friends and neighbours, to the
memory of Ellen Fisher,” born 1759, died 1837. Similar windows,
north and south, in the chancel, were given by Thomas Clifton,
esq., in 1845, also a second, on the south side, by Lady Eleanor
Cecily Clifton, in 1871. The north side aisle contains six handsome
windows inserted respectively to the memories of Anne Shepherd
Birley, died 1872; James Fair, died 1871, by J. T. Clifton, esq.;
Sarah Agnes, wife of W. C. Dowding, clerk, M.A., died 1869, by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_436"></a>[436]</span>
her maternal aunt, Agnes Newsham; her mother and sisters, by
Anne Wilson, 1871; Margaret Hornby, died 1866; William and
Agnes Birdsworth and of their father and mother, by their
surviving relatives. In the south side aisle are two memorial
windows, one being to Henry Miller, died 1859, aged 46 years,
and his infant son, died 1852, by his wife Caroline A. Miller; and
the other to John Stevenson, died 1872, aged 78 years; Jane
Stevenson, died 1872, aged 64 years; William Elsworth Stevenson,
died 1869, aged 31 years; and Jane Stevenson, died 1872, aged 25
years. The clerestory of the church is lighted by twelve single
windows, each bearing the representation of a saint, all of which
were presented by private individuals.</p>

<p>In 1872 the chancel was enlarged and a new vestry erected,
whilst the solitary gallery at the west end, formerly used<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_437"></a>[437]</span>
for the choir, was converted into commodious sitting accommodation
for the congregation. During the same year half an
acre was added to the north of the burial ground, and a fresh
boundary wall, facing Church Road completed, the iron work
being given by the late John Stevenson, J.P., of West Beach,
and the stone work by the late John Knowles, proprietor of
the Clifton Arms Hotel. The tower contains a peal of eight
bells. John Talbot Clifton, esq., of Lytham Hall, is the patron
of the living. The parish register begins in 1679.</p>

<p>The churchyard, which is encircled by a thick plantation of
trees, possesses many very handsome monuments, but none of
historical importance. The oldest gravestone still legible lies in
close proximity to the ancient sun-dial, and bears the date 1672.
The parish schools, erected in 1853, stand in Church Road.</p>

<p>Dodsworth informs us that in the neighbourhood of Lytham
there existed, in 1601, a village called Waddum Thorp, and that
eleven years previously the Horsebank was a green pasture for
cattle. Dr. Leigh affirms that the hamlet in question was
peopled by some Saxon fishermen. The locality alluded to in
the foundation document as Snartsalte is now denominated
Saltcoats, and was, like several neighbouring places, the site of a
salt manufactory in remote days. Geoffrey Gillet worked the
Saltcoats manufactory. Cambden in describing the extractive
process says:—“They pour water from time to time upon heaps
of sand till it grows brackish, and then with a turf fire they boil
it into a white salt.” Bowden wrote, in 1722, concerning the
same subject:—“On many places on the coast the inhabitants
gather heaps of sand together which, having lain some time, they
put into troughs full of holes at the bottom, pour water upon
them, and boil the lees into white salt.”</p>

<p>About 1800 the hamlet comprised several mud and thatch
cottages, interspersed here and there with a fair number of habitations
of recent origin, built with bricks and slated. There were
also two inns in existence, the Wheat Sheaf and the Clifton Arms,
besides two small licensed houses. The Wheat Sheaf was erected
in Clifton Street during the year 1794, and almost simultaneously,
but a little later, the Clifton Arms arose on the opposite side of
the thoroughfare, facing the sea. There were several shops in
the village, and in Douglas Street a house of confinement, containing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_438"></a>[438]</span>
separate cells, for the detention and punishment of any
offenders against the law. The most pretentious dwellings stood
upon the northern portion of the tract known as the Marsh, and
all of them were newly constructed. One near the western
extremity was a substantial house with gardens and plantation,
inhabited by the clergyman of the parish, the Rev. Robt. Lister.
In close proximity was a marine villa with a Chinese porch,
belonging to William Hornby, esq., of Kirkham; and a row of
white cottages, called Lizmahago, after a race horse of John
Clifton, esq., who had erected them for the accommodation of
visitors. A pretty white villa was placed more to the rear, and
several well-constructed lodging-houses studded the ground
between those just mentioned and the old village, where clay and
straw had been the time-honoured building materials. The
beach afforded no more than three bathing machines, but sundry
improvements, both in multiplying the vans and in the establishment
of a warm sea-water bath, were in contemplation. No elegant
promenade with its expansive sward, as at present, defined the landward
margin of the beach, but the whole space, at one end of which
Mr. Cookson had erected a windmill, was covered with miniature
sand-hills and star-grass, unfolding a most uninviting and deterring
aspect to the pedestrian. The church of St. Cuthbert’s was built
of rubble, rough cast and whitened, and certainly possessed, both
externally and internally, no very extensive claims to architectural
beauty. The instrumental part of the service was accomplished
by means of a clarionet and a bass fiddle. The religious edifice
stood in the midst of fields, and was approached by a footpath,
sufficiently wide to admit the passage of bathing vans, which were
occasionally had recourse to by visitors on wet Sundays, in order
to attend the service with dry garments, being then, and for some
time afterwards, the only covered vehicles in the place. Lytham
Hall, embosomed in lofty trees and plantations, formed an imposing
object, being situated half a mile inland, between the village and
the church. This noble mansion, comprising three fronts, of
which the east is the principal, was commenced in 1757 and
completed in 1764, by Thomas Clifton, esq., and superseded the
original Hall, erected about 1606, by Sir Cuthbert Clifton. At
the date now under examination, its possessor, John Clifton, esq.,
had laid out a race-course for training purposes, of three miles<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_439"></a>[439]</span>
and a quarter in circumference, in the fields to the north-west of
the church; and close at hand were excellent paddocks and stables,
filled with a considerable stud of fine blood horses. The residence
of the trainer was an elegant villa near the stables, surrounded
with a shrubbery. Two steamers plied daily in the season between
Preston and Lytham, but the larger share of the company
arrived by the road, the journey having a few years previously
been rendered more direct by the opening of a route across the
marshes, past Freckleton, instead of the former circuitous one
through Kirkham. In 1801 the population amounted to 920
persons.</p>

<p>During the ensuing twenty years Lytham made steady, if not
rapid, progress. Buildings of modern and pretty designs sprang
up along the beach, whilst others of substantial workmanship
were visible in the lines of various thoroughfares, especially in
Clifton Street. The two hotels already specified, underwent
enlargements, owing to the growing pressure on their accommodation,
and a fresh inn, the Commercial, was erected on the
land behind the present Market Hotel, the front and main
entrance of the house having an easterly aspect, overshadowed
by several lofty trees. A little beyond the north gable end of the
inn, in a westerly direction, were the old gates of the park
attached to Lytham Hall, near to which, on the road side,
was stationed the pinfold, constructed of cobble stones, in a quadrangular
form, with an embattled tower rising about eight feet
above the height of the walls. A small Baptist chapel, having a
school-room connected with it, also existed, standing on part of
the ground now occupied by the premises of Mr. Edmondson,
draper, the remaining portion being covered by the residence and
shop of that gentleman’s father, who owned the chapel, and acted
as its minister. The chapel would hold about thirty worshippers,
and contained three or four rows of forms and a pulpit; whilst
the school-room, of equal dimensions, was let to a person for a
private day seminary.</p>

<p>During the summer months, hundreds of day visitors, in
addition to the more permanent ones who constituted the company,
found their way in carts, waggons, or lighter vehicles, to the
coast at Lytham, from Preston, Blackburn, Burnley, and other
inland towns, for the pleasure of enjoying once, at least, a year,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_440"></a>[440]</span>
an invigorating bath in the sea. The fortnightly spring tides
were the signals which foretold the advent of these huge pic-nic
parties, for such it seems appropriate to style them, who flocked
down to the shore, generally bringing their own provisions with
them, and after disporting themselves amidst the waves, and procuring
amusement in various ways during the day, returned quietly or
hilariously home to their several destinations, in the evening or following
morning, in the manner they had arrived. Some from
the more remote places prolonged their sojourn for three days.
Races for the better class of farmers’ horses were held annually
on Wit-Monday, over the sward which runs from the windmill to
the site of an old lime kiln about one mile distant, in the direction
of Saltcoats, the course being round that spot to the starting
point. These races, which are described as having been very fair
contests, were kept up for many years. The prizes competed for
were saddles, bridles, whips, etc. The bowling greens of Lytham
amounted to two, which were attached to the Clifton Arms and
Commercial Hotels, and were well patronised.</p>

<p>The following description of the attractions of Lytham, published
in 1821, furnishes a pretty correct idea of the recreations
afforded by the watering-place about that date:—“Lytham is a
very salubrious place; its walks are pleasant and diversified. You
may walk for miles on the sand westward. You may trip to the
Hey-houses and get bad ale. Common-side offers a journey,
which, if you please, ends at Blackpool. The walks are many and
various for those who love exercise; the lazy will soon tire here,
but the active will never be at a loss. The sands are fine—the
sea breeze pleasant—the air is impregnated with health. Sailing
may be had at tide time; boats are occasionally going to Preston
and over the water to Southport. There are baths, shower, cold,
and warm for invalides. Old Hugh Holmes, the shaver, doctor,
and shopkeeper, is an old man, thin and meagre, conceited to a
tittle, and remarkably fond of chit-chat. The people here bathe
not at all, whilst those from a distance think it a blessing.
Holmes, the barber, said he had never bathed in his life, nor
could I persuade him to do so. He said that he was sound in
body, and if so, why dip in the briny sea at all.”</p>

<p>In 1821 the population of Lytham amounted to 1,292 persons,
consisting of 258 families; and in 1825 the parish contained 258<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_441"></a>[441]</span>
houses, the occupants of 75 of which were employed chiefly in
agriculture, and of 55 in trade, fishing, or handicraft, those of the
remaining 128 being unclassified. Three years later the Wheat
Sheaf Inn and a wide range of thatched buildings adjoining
were demolished, and after leaving the spacious opening, called
Dicconson Terrace, leading down to the beach, several improved
dwellings and a billiard-room were placed on the remainder of
the ground. The greater part of the marine frontage had been
levelled, and efforts commenced to lay out a species of walk or
promenade. The houses standing along the shore line were
usually hired furnished by families for varying periods, at prices
from one and a half to three guineas per week, their value being
estimated by the number of bed-rooms, each of which represented
ten shillings and sixpence a week. Other villas in the watering-place
were similarly let, but lodgings could be procured amongst
the humble cottages on a weekly payment of four shillings and
sixpence by each individual. The prices at the hotels for board
and lodging, exclusive of wine and liquors, were—at the Clifton
Arms, seven shillings a day in private, and six shillings in public;
the Commercial, five shillings and sixpence; and the Ship, a new
inn erected since 1820, three shillings and sixpence. Of trades
and professions in the village there were three milliners, six
drapers, three boot and shoe makers, five joiners and cabinet
makers, one druggist, two blacksmiths, one ship carpenter, one
custom-house officer, one tide-waiter, one corn miller, three
butchers, five grocers, two coal dealers, one confectioner, one
surgeon, one attorney, and one clergyman. In addition it should
be mentioned that a solitary ladies’ seminary had been established
within the previous twelve months. “I recollect,” says Mr.
Whittle, in his <i>Marina</i>, “visiting Lytham during July, 1824,
when Mr. Lardner’s troop of comedians were performing in
what was termed the ‘New Theatre, Lytham,’ Cibber’s admired
comedy of a ‘Journey to London, or a Bold Push for a Fortune,’
and the laughable farce of the ‘Irish Tutor, or New Lights.’
The chief of the stage business was done by the Lardners,
consisting of father, mother, son, and daughter. Likenesses were
also taken in miniature by Mr. Lardner, senior, at from two to
five guineas each! and the polite art of dancing taught by
Lardner, junior. We saw in succession performed Morton’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_442"></a>[442]</span>
comedy of ‘Speed the Plough, or the Farmer’s Glory;’ ‘Lovers’
Vows, or the Child of Love’; and Coleman’s admired and
excellent comedy of the ‘Poor Gentleman’; all of which were
tolerably got up, but the scenery was not of that kind which
befitted a place of dramatic exhibition.” During the season three
coaches ran regularly from Preston to Lytham and returned,
their times of departure being—from Preston, at 12 noon, 5 in
the evening, and 7 in the evening; and from Lytham, at 6 in the
morning, 9 in the morning, and half-past 4 in the afternoon. In
addition to these coaches, occasional public conveyances and many
private vehicles brought their loads of pleasure-seekers to the
village, especially during Easter and Whit-tides. Letters arrived
at half-past 9 in the morning and were despatched at 4 in the
afternoon. In 1828 the buildings situated in the vicinity of the
beach were, commencing at the eastern extremity of the line and
travelling westward, a house, occupied by Miss Dennett, Rimmer’s
and Butcher’s cottages, the Baths with a house adjoining, two
newly erected dwellings, Cookson’s cottages, Rawstorne’s Marine
Cottage, Craven’s and Hampson’s cottages, Clifton Place, Buck’s
cottages, Silcock’s and Miller’s cottages, Townend’s and Captain
Cookson’s residences, Mr. Barton’s house, Captain Fell’s and Mrs.
Birdworth’s residences, Mr. Fisher’s house, Lizmahago houses,
Hornby’s Chinese villa, the Parsonage, in the occupation of the
Rev. Robert Lister; the Parish Church, situated more inland,
and Church-house, a rural place. Mr. Corry, in his History of
Lancashire, published about that time, states:—“That the
increase of Lytham has not been so rapid as in many villages,
where the people are engaged in manufacture; but a considerable
part of the visitors and settlers within the last twenty years have
been opulent individuals, who were induced by the beauty of the
spot and the benefit derived from bathing in the sea water, to
resort to this pleasing village.” The houses were unnumbered
and recognised by the titles bestowed upon them, or the names of
their owners. Lamps for the autumn and winter evenings were
unknown in the streets, whilst libraries, news-rooms, and livery
stables were things of the future. The Clifton Arms Hotel had
recently been overlaid with a thick coating of cement resembling
stone, and the Commercial Inn had undergone sundry enlargements.
An ornamental enclosure or garden had been formed on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_443"></a>[443]</span>
the land of the present Market-house, surrounded by a palisading
and planted with flowers and shrubs. A carriage road also had
been lately made from the village to the church of St. Cuthbert.</p>

<p>In 1831 the census of Lytham showed a total of 1,523 residents,
being an increase of 231 over the population ten years before; and
three years subsequently the ancient church of the parish was
levelled to the ground and the erection of the present edifice
commenced. The early growth of the summer resort was much
retarded by the exceedingly short terms upon which building
leases were granted. Previous to 1820 all land reverted to the
lord of the manor forty years after its provisional purchase had
been effected, so that there was little inducement for either the
speculative or private individual to upraise habitations where the
tenure was so unsatisfactory. About that date the duration of
leases was extended to sixty years, and even this slight advance in
a more liberal direction was not without influence in promoting
the development of the place, but no great rapidity characterised
the multiplication of houses until a later epoch, when periods of
99 and 999 years were offered to purchasers. In 1839 the Roman
Catholics erected a chapel, dedicated to St. Peter, at the east
corner of Clifton Street. Previously the members of this sect
had worshipped in a small chapel belonging to Lytham Hall,
which had superseded the domestic oratory of the Cliftons, in
the days when they professed the Romish creed. The edifice in
Clifton Street is of brick and has a priests’ residence and schools
attached, the whole being prettily encircled by willow trees and
a low wall.</p>

<p>The returning seasons brought increasing streams of visitors
to the shores of Lytham, and practically proved that the
delightful and invigorating influences of the climate and sea
were well and widely appreciated by the populace of the large
inland towns. The marine esplanade and the firm sands left by
the receding tide were ever alive with crowds of people, who either
for health or pleasure, or a combination of the two, had arrived in
the watering-place. The bathing vans were still unequal to the
demands on their accommodation, and many were compelled to
dispense with their decorous shelter, and unrobe themselves on the
more secluded parts of the beach. To have returned home again
without immersing their body in the buoyant sea would to most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_444"></a>[444]</span>
of them have been to omit the chief object of their journey, many,
indeed, having such an exalted idea of the remedial and hygienic
properties of the water that they imbibed huge draughts, and even
filled bottles with it, for future use, or for friends who had been
unable to come themselves. There were few amusements for the
visitors beyond those enumerated earlier, but had there been none
other, the exhilarating breeze and bath, coupled with the novel
surroundings, would have possessed sufficient charm to insure a
thronged season year after year.</p>

<p>In 1841 the population numbered 2,047 persons, being a rise of
no less than 524 in the inhabitants during the preceding ten
years, more than double the excess observed in the census of 1831
over its antecessor. During the previous twelve months the
Clifton Arms Hotel, in Clifton Street, had been abolished and a
stately building, bearing the same name, erected on the front,
where it now stands, very considerable enlarged and beautified
under the proprietorship of the late Mr. John Knowles, who
purchased it on lease from the lord of the manor, and by whose
representatives the Hotel and appurtenances were sold to a
company of gentlemen in 1875.</p>

<p>The 16th of February, 1846, initiated a new era in the history
and progress of Lytham, for on that day the branch line connecting
this popular resort with the Preston and Wyre Railway
was formally opened. At an early hour the town evinced
manifest signs that the inhabitants were bent on doing full
honour to the introduction of their invaluable ally; flags and
banners floated from the church and the residences of many of
the inhabitants, and later in the day the streets were thronged
with processions and spectators of all grades. The directors and
a large party of the neighbouring gentry assembled by invitation
at Lytham Hall, and after partaking of luncheon proceeded to the
newly erected station, where the “opening train,” consisting of
an engine, gaily decorated, and fourteen carriages, awaited their
arrival. Amongst the gentlemen who accompanied Thomas
Clifton, esq., and Mrs. Clifton, on the formal trip to Kirkham and
back, were John Laidlay, W. Taylor, J. Dewhurst, T. W. Nelson,
Frederick Kemp, C. Swainson, James Fair, E. Houghton, W. H.
Hornby, T. R. W. ffrance, P. Rycroft, W. Royds, and William
Birley, esquires, the Revs. R. Moore and W. Birley, and Colonel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_445"></a>[445]</span>
Rawstorne. The train departed amid a volley of cheers and
discharge of cannon, and proceeded to Kirkham; the return
journey was performed in fifteen minutes. The carriage station
was 140 feet long by 53 feet wide, and covered by a somewhat
unique roof of twelve wooden arches, put together in segments
and secured by nuts and screws, all the timber ends butting upon
each other like the stones of an arch, but as solid, from their
peculiar construction, as if the whole had been cut out of a single
block of timber. The Lytham line diverged from the main railway
at a point about a mile to the north-west of Kirkham, and was
nearly five miles in length. It passed within a short distance of the
village of Wrea, where a station was built, and terminated in the
immediate vicinity of the Roman Catholic chapel in this town.</p>

<p>The impetus given to the building trade of Lytham by the
opening of the railway and the almost simultaneous extension of
ground leases was soon visible in the erection of numerous houses.
A Wesleyan chapel, capable of holding 200 hearers, was built, before
the close of the year, in Bath Street; but this structure having, as
time progressed, become inadequate to the wants of the congregation,
the foundation stone of a new one was laid on the 12th of
September, 1867, by T. C. Hincksman, esq., of Lytham, at the
corner of Park and Westby Streets, service being first conducted
there on the 23rd of September in the ensuing year, by the Rev.
John Bedford, of Manchester. The chapel is faced with Longridge
stone and white brick. In front are stone columns and pilasters
nearly thirty feet high, surmounted by Corinthian caps, massive
cornice, parapet, pediment, etc. It contains seats for about 500
persons. The old Wesleyan chapel is now used as a literary and
social Institute, established in 1872. In 1847 the growth and
prosperity of Lytham rendered it necessary that some form of
local government should be adopted, and the inhabitants applied
for and obtained an Improvement Act, by which the regulation of
all public matters was placed in the hands of a board of commissioners
elected from amongst the ratepayers. On the 13th of
May in that year, the corner stone of a substantial lighthouse was
laid on the “Double Stanner” bank, by Peter Haydock, esq.,
chairman of the Ribble Navigation Company, at whose expense
the work was accomplished; but on the 20th of January, 1863, a
heavy storm swept over the coast, and amongst other damages<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_446"></a>[446]</span>
effected by its fury was the overthrow of this pile, which was
subsequently re-erected on the Star Hills, far removed from the
destructive influence of the waves, and perhaps more efficacious,
from its greater elevation, as a beacon. During the year 1848 a
Market Hall was built on an open space, formerly the ornamental
garden referred to in a late page. In the month of June the
edifice was completed and ready for use, being constructed of
brick and supplied with stalls for various articles, such as fish,
vegetables, toys, etc. The tower was elevated in 1872 to receive
a large clock, the gift of Lady Eleanor Cecily Clifton, and during
the following twelve months additional dials and illuminative
power were added. The Hall is prettily situated in an enclosure
of elm trees.</p>

<p>Another church, dedicated to St. John, was erected on the east
beach in 1848-9, and consecrated on the 11th September, 1850.
The site was granted by John Talbot Clifton, esq., who retains
the patronage of the living, and the expense of construction
defrayed by subscription. The edifice is of stone, and includes a
nave, side aisles, transepts, chancel, porch, and tower, surmounted
by a lofty spire. The side aisles are separated from the nave by
pointed arches on circular columns. The chancel has since been
enlarged. Within the church are several memorial windows, one
of which, in the west end, is in memory of “James and Elizabeth
Fair, who died August 16, 1871, and July 27, 1867,” inserted by
their children. By the side of this is a smaller stained window to
Mr. Bannerman by his widow. The east window of the chancel
is magnificently illuminated, and another, lighting the scholars’
chapel on the south of that part, was placed by the Rev. W. H.
Self “to his wife, Mary, ob. 1859.” The windows in the north
and south transepts are, respectively, to “Thomas Miller, ob.
1865,” and “Thomas Clifton, ob. 1851.” There are no mural
tablets. The organ was presented by William Bradshaw Swainson,
esq., of Cooper Hill, near Preston, “as a tribute of affection,
in memory of his mother, Catherine Swainson, who died at
Lytham on the 1st of February, 1848.” The instrument was
enlarged by the aid of public contributions in 1874. The lectern
was presented by Margaret Ellen Clifford, the second wife of the
Rev. W. H. Self, <i>in memoriam</i> of her mother, Mrs. Hannah
Biddell, in 1867. The tower contains a peal of six bells. An<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_447"></a>[447]</span>
ecclesiastical parish was apportioned to the church of St. John in
1870. The Rev. William Henry Self, M.A., was the earliest
incumbent and subsequently became the first vicar. The Rev.
Gregory Smart, M.A., is the present vicar. The graveyard is a
spacious area defined by a neat stone wall, and contains numerous
elegant monuments. The vicarage house stands a very little
distance to the east side of the church, and is a handsome villa
residence. To the rear of the burial ground, and separated therefrom
by a narrow street, are the parish schools erected in 1851 by
subscription, and grants from the Council of Education and the
National Society.</p>

<p>The want of proper illumination along the thoroughfares of
Lytham during the long evenings of the autumn months, was a
source of considerable inconvenience to the visitors, and induced
many to vacate the place earlier than otherwise they would have
done, so that the commissioners determined to erect gas works by
loans on the security of the rates, and remedy the evil as soon as
possible. On the 28th of October, 1850, the streets were lighted
for the first time with gas. In 1851 the residents of Lytham
amounted to 2,695, showing an increase of 648 persons since 1841.
It was about this time that a lifeboat was stationed at Lytham,
purchased by subscription, and named the “Eleanor Cecily,” out
of compliment to the lady of the manor. The boat-house stands
on the promenade to the east, in close proximity to the old windmill,
and is now occupied by a new and larger craft, presented by
Thomas Clayton, esq., of Wakefield, in 1863.</p>

<p>Throughout the succeeding ten years the area of the town
continued to expand with fair rapidity. Many graceful villas
were added to those already existing on the front, whilst fresh
shops and lodging houses arose along the different thoroughfares,
plainly evincing a determination on the part of the inhabitants to
keep pace with the spreading popularity of the place by creating
ample accommodation for the crowds of visitors. A corps of
Volunteer Riflemen was enrolled under Captain Lennox in 1860,
during the month of January. The census of 1861 furnished a
total of 3,189 residents.</p>

<p>The advisability of connecting the two watering-places of
Blackpool and Lytham by a coast railway was now freely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_448"></a>[448]</span>
discussed, and the scheme having been favourably entertained by
a number of affluent gentlemen, the requisite powers were sought
from Parliament for its formation. In May, 1861, the desired act
received the royal assent, and on the ensuing 4th of September
the first sod of the new line was cut by T. H. Clifton, esq., M.P.,
the son and heir of the lord of the manor, in Lytham Park. The
directors of the company were E. C. Milne, esq., (chairman), of
Warton Lodge; John Talbot Clifton, T. Langton Birley, Charles
Birley, James Fair, Robert Rawcliffe, and Thomas Fair, esqrs.
The distance, about 7½ miles, was spanned by a single line,
stations being placed at the two termini and at South Shore, in
addition to which there was a gate-house at Andsell’s road, near
the town, where it was proposed to have a booking office. The
railway was virtually finished in the autumn of 1862, but the
formal opening was postponed until the 4th of April, 1863. At
that date, which occurred on Saturday, flags and banners floated
from many of the windows, whilst the bells of St. Cuthbert’s
church rang out merry peals at intervals throughout the day.
No further ceremony, however, was observed on the occasion,
than the running of a train to Blackpool and back with a select
party of invited guests. Regular public traffic commenced on
Monday. During 1871 this line was amalgamated with the
Preston and Wyre, of which the Lancashire and Yorkshire, and
the London and North Western Railway Companies are the
lessees. The track was doubled in 1874, by laying down another
length of metals, and connected with the Kirkham and Lytham
branch. In the same year on the 1st of July, a spacious and
handsome station which had been erected according to the design
of C. Axon, esq., of Poulton, was brought into service, and the use
of the original one belonging to the branch just specified discontinued
for passenger traffic, the whole of which, both from Kirkham
and Blackpool, is now directed to the recently built central edifice.
It is expected that in course of time the coast line thus established
from Preston through Kirkham, Lytham, St. Anne’s, South Shore,
to Blackpool will supersede the old route through Poulton to the
last named resort for the conveyance of passengers. Important
alterations, it should be noted, were effected in the course of the
branch from Kirkham to Lytham immediately preceding its
junction with the Blackpool and Lytham line, by which the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_449"></a>[449]</span>
corner lying north of and between Kirkham and Wrea was cut
off. The rails were also doubled.</p>

<p>Reverting to the town itself, we find that the day which gave
the small coast communication between Blackpool and Lytham
to the public use, also witnessed another event—the opening of
the Baths and Assembly Rooms, situated on the beach, about
midway between the Clifton Arms and the Neptune Hotels. The
building is of brick, with stone dressings, and presents an elegant
and rather imposing appearance. It comprises private and
swimming baths for both sexes; dressing-rooms, retiring-rooms,
news and general reading-room, and a capacious saloon, able to
contain 350 persons, used for concerts, balls, and other entertainments.
Early in the same year a Congregational Church was
completed in Bannister Street, the corner stone of which had
been laid on the 17th of October, 1861, by Sir James Watts, of
Manchester. The edifice is formed of Longridge stone, in the
ornamental Gothic style of architecture, with a spire, and will
hold about 500 worshippers. Within the enclosure wall surrounding
the church are the Sunday schools connected with it.
The first pile of the marine pier, extending into the estuary of
the Ribble from the promenade, was screwed into the ground on
the 8th of June, 1864. The structure was designed by E. Birch,
esq., C.E., and is supported on hollow cylindrical columns,
arranged in clusters. The length of the deck is 914 feet, the
whole of which is encircled by a continuous line of side seats,
whilst a lounging or waiting-room is stationed on the head.
The entrance is protected by gates and toll-houses. Easter
Monday, the 17th of April, 1865, was the day set apart for the
ceremonious opening of the new erection. The town was gaily
decorated with the bunting, and no efforts were spared to do full
justice to the importance of so auspicious an event. Immense
confluences of people arrived in excursion trains, running at
greatly reduced fares, from the business centres of Lancashire and
Yorkshire, and the streets and esplanade were literally inundated
with spectators from all grades of society. To Lady Eleanor
Cecily Clifton was delegated the honourable duty of declaring the
pier accessible to promenaders, and at the selected time, that lady,
accompanied by her son, T. H. Clifton, esq., proceeded to the
spot, where the necessary form was gone through; a large procession,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_450"></a>[450]</span>
headed by a marshall, and consisting of the mayor and
corporation of Preston, the directors of the Ribble Navigation
Company, naval and military officers, clergy, the several directors
of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway, the Lytham and
Blackpool Railway, the Blackpool and the Southport Pier
Companies, and numerous gentry. Unabated prosperity continued
to shine on the watering-place, whose limits were annually
extended by additional buildings, and in all parts there was to be
observed that aspect of recent improvements and embellishments
which is ever indicative of a propitious fortune.</p>

<p>The population in 1871 had reached the high figure of 7,902,
having more than doubled during the previous ten years, and if
further evidence were required of the development of Lytham,
none more irrefutable and convincing could be given than this
wonderful multiplication of the inhabitants. On the 3rd of
August, 1871, a neat Gothic cottage hospital, erected at the east
end of the resort, in Preston Road, at the sole expense of the lord
of the manor, was pronounced open for the reception of patients,
and transferred to a committee of management. The building
stands in three acres of land tastefully laid out, and comprises a
central portion of two stories, with a wing on either side, containing
two large wards (each with four beds), two sitting-rooms,
surgery, bath-rooms, and laundry, on the ground floor; upstairs
are four beds for invalids and a sleeping apartment for the matron.
The hospital is intended for the poor labouring under disease or
accidents. Luke Fisher, esq., M.D., is the physician in charge.
From 1871 up to the present date (1876), there is nothing calling
for separate comment beyond those matters in connection with
the railway and station already noticed, with the exception of the
beautiful park-garden, occupying the land formerly known as
Hungry Moor, and instituted through the liberality of J. T.
Clifton, esq., who bestowed the name of the Lowther Gardens on
the enclosure so gracefully designed and planted, and gave free
access to the public on its completion, about three years ago.
The progress of the town within the short interval at present
under consideration, has been marked by even greater rapidity
than that which shed such a halo of prosperity around the period
more immediately preceding; and there is no apparent prospect
that the powerful impetus which has thus far exerted its beneficial<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_451"></a>[451]</span>
influence on the place is likely to experience any diminution.
Indeed it may with reason be anticipated that when passenger
traffic is more thoroughly established along the coast line from
Preston to Blackpool, the demand for residential accommodation
will be still greater than that which supplies abundant occupation
to the builders to-day.</p>

<p>The original endowment of Lytham Free School was derived
from the following sources:—In 1702, the Rev. James Threlfall,
of St. Cuthbert’s church, gave £5; and somewhere about the
same time, William Elston, who died in 1704, presented £3 3s. 0d.,
for the use of the parish. Subsequently these sums of money
were supplemented by a grant of £10 from John Shepherd, of
Mythorp, and the whole invested, the interest being applied to
local charitable purposes. The benefaction of John Shepherd
was bestowed in trust upon Thomas Shepherd and his heirs, to
the intent that the interest should be applied to the “use of such
poor children’s schooling, as they, with two or three of the most
substantial men of the parish, whom they chose to consult, should
think fit;”<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> but it is doubtful how it was disposed of until 1720,
when the three separate sums mentioned were incorporated, for
a motive stated directly, with a collection made in aid of those
who had suffered damage from a serious inundation in that year.
The inhabitants were unable to agree upon an equable distribution
of the collection specified, and decided, by way of settling
the affair, to “make a free school,”<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> with it and the other sums.
The total capital thus acquired amounted to more than £100.
In 1728 £60 was derived from the residue of John Harrison’s
estate, by the direction of his will. William Gaulter gave to
Lytham school in 1745 several securities for money, amounting in
all to £99, and three years later bequeathed the residue of his
personal estate, except 20s., to the same object, making a total
benefaction of £335. The whole of the endowment fund has
been invested in land, and the school has always been in the
hands of trustees, who have control over the teachers and all
matters affecting its interest and government.</p>

<p>Cookson’s Charity is the interest of £10 bequeathed by Thomas
Cookson at an unknown date before 1776, to purchase books for
the poor children of the parish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_452"></a>[452]</span></p>

<p>Leyland’s Charity represents the sum of £60 left by Elizabeth
Leyland to trustees, in 1734, in order that it might be laid out,
and the annual revenue therefrom devoted to the assistance of
the poor, either in relieving the elderly, or providing instruction
for the young.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">St. Annes-on-the-Sea.</span> The locality in which the new
watering-place is rapidly developing was indicated in the
foundation charter of the Lytham Benedictine Cell as Kilgrimol.
It has been suggested that the peculiar orthography of the word
Kilgrimol points to there having been at some era a religious
settlement, presided over by Culdees, the priests of Columba,<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>
but it is more probable that the name is derived from the two
British words <i>kilgury</i>, a corner, and <i>mul</i> or <i>meol</i>, a sand-hill. At
a later epoch the district was known as Cross or Churchyard Slack,
and tradition records that an oratory existed there until such time
as it was swallowed up by an earthquake, long years ago. Mr.
Thornber, in discussing the statement, advances the following fact
as some evidence in favour of its veracity:—“Churchyard Slack
is situated in a hollow, having on the north side a rising ground
called Stony-hill, and at the distance of three-quarters of a mile a
similar elevation, though not so marked. On these ridges are
found innumerable small boulders of grey granite, having apparently
been acted upon by fire; but it is particularly remarkable
that not one can be found amongst them entirely whole. Similar
stones in less quantities are discovered in the intervening space,
all more or less broken.”</p>

<p>On the immediate outskirts of the embryo town is the small
hamlet of Heyhouses, at which a school was established in 1821,
and enlarged in 1853; and it was there that Lady Eleanor Cecily
Clifton erected a church, in memory of the late James Fair, esq.,
of Lytham, on a site presented by her husband, the lord of the
manor. The foundation stone of the edifice was laid in June,
1872, and on Wednesday, the 6th of August, in the ensuing year,
the church and burial ground, occupying jointly 2½ acres, were
consecrated by the Lord Bishop of Manchester. The interior
contains accommodation for 300 persons, 145 seats being appropriated,
and 155 free. The roof is of red tiles instead of slates.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_453"></a>[453]</span>
The building is at present a chapel of ease to St. Cuthbert’s,
Lytham, but will, when occasion requires, have a separate
ecclesiastical parish of its own.</p>

<p>The whole of the land of St. Annes-on-the-Sea was leased to a
company of gentlemen for a term of 1,100 years by John Talbot
Clifton, esq., and on the 31st of March, 1875, the formality of
laying the first stone of the future watering-place was gone
through by Master John T. Clifton, the eldest son of T. H. Clifton,
esq., M.P. The ceremony was accomplished amidst a large
concourse of people, and was in fact the commencement of the
handsome and commodious hotel near to the railway station,
which has since been completed. The estate has been judiciously
and tastefully arranged by Messrs. Maxwell and Tuke, architects,
of Bury, and is intersected by broad streets with gentle curves.
The houses are intended to be built either singly or in pairs with
few exceptions, but in no case will any group comprise more than
six; gardens in each instance are to front the dwellings. A
promenade, 3,000 feet in length and 180 feet in width, has been
formed with asphalt along the marine aspect, and already between
twenty and thirty villas have been raised on the sides of the
recently made thoroughfares. A public garden with conservatories
is also in course of formation, as well as efficient gas-works
and other requisites.</p>

are mentioned, and have been identified, respectively,
with Upper, Middle, and Out Rawcliffes, the last being
stated to contain three carucates, and the others two
carucates each. In the <i>Testa de Nevill</i> it is entered that the
grandfather of Theobald Walter gave four carucates of land in
(Upper) Rawcliffe, Thistleton, and Greenhalgh, to his daughter
Alice, on her marriage with Orm Magnus. William de Lancaster
held Upper Rawcliffe at the time of his death in 1240; and in
1248 Theobald Walter, or le Botiler, had lands in Upper Rawcliffe
and Mid Rawcliffe, as well as the manor of Out Rawcliffe, the
principal portion of which had doubtless descended to him from

Joan, the daughter and heiress of John de Rigmayden, and John
de Coupland held Upper Rawcliffe between them. John de
Coupland had married the widow of Sir William de Goucy, and
was the gallant soldier who captured David II., king of Scotland,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_455"></a>[455]</span>
on the battle field at Durham, and was rewarded for his bravery
by Edward III., with the rank of knight-banneret and a grant of
land. Joan de Rigmayden, the heiress, probably married William
Southworth, as he is described as lord of Upper Rawcliffe a little
later; Ellen, the sole child and heiress of William Southworth,
became the wife of Robert Urswick, of Urswick, and their second
son, Thomas, who succeeded to the estates of Rawcliffe, etc., and
was knighted, left at his decease a daughter, who espoused, about
1430, John, the third son of Sir Richard Kirkby, of Kirkby.
John Kirkby resided at Upper Rawcliffe Hall,<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> or White Hall, as
it was subsequently designated, and was succeeded by his eldest
son, William, who in his turn left the lands and mansion to his
heir and offspring John Kirkby. The eldest son of the last
gentleman, by his wife, the daughter of—Broughton, was
William Kirkby; and he, in course of time, inherited the
property, and married, in 1507, Elizabeth, the daughter of
William Thornborough, of Hampsfield, by whom he had issue
John, George, William, Richard, Henry, Anne, Elizabeth, and
Jane. John Kirkby, the heir, was living in 1567, but died
without offspring, as also did his brother George, so that Upper
Rawcliffe Hall and estate passed to the third son, William Kirkby,
who married Isabell, the daughter of John Butler, of Kirkland.<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a>
The Kirkbys continued in sole possession of the township until
1631, when Thomas Westby, of Mowbreck, purchased from them
Upper Rawcliffe Hall and the estate attached, both of which he
settled upon Major George Westby, the eldest son of his second
marriage with Elizabeth, the daughter of Thomas Preston, of
Holkar, and widow of Thomas Lathom, of Parbold. George
Westby resided at White Hall, as the manor house was now called,
and was twice married, being succeeded by John, the only child
by his first wife, Margaret, the daughter of Thomas Hesketh, of
Mains. Both George Westby and his third brother, Bernard,
were royalist officers. John Westby, of Upper Rawcliffe, espoused,
in 1684, Jane, the daughter of Thomas Bleasdale, of Alston, and
had issue John, Joseph, James, and Alice, who became the wife of
Thomas Gilibrand, of Dunken Hall, near Chorley. John Westby<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_456"></a>[456]</span>
the eldest son, inherited the mansion and land on the death of his
father in 1708, and married, in the following year, Mary, the
daughter of Thomas Hawett, of Ormskirk, by whom he had Thomas;
George, who died in 1776, leaving several children by his wife
Mary, the daughter of ⸺ Field; John, died unmarried; Cuthbert,
died childless; and Jane. Thomas Westby came into the estate
in 1745, when his father was accidentally killed, and espoused
Margaret, the daughter and heiress of William Shuttleworth, of
Turnover Hall, and Bridget, his wife, who was one of four
daughters, the sole offspring of John Westby, of Mowbreck. The
children of Thomas Westby, of White Hall, and, ultimately, of
one fourth of Mowbreck, were John, who died unmarried in 1811;
William, died unmarried in 1811, just before his brother; Joseph,
died young; Robert, died childless in 1800; Thomas; Bridget,
an abbess at Liege; and two Marys, one of whom died in infancy.
Thomas, the fifth son, held Mowbreck, White, and Turnover Halls
and estates, on the decease of his eldest brother, and at his own
death in 1829, without issue, was succeeded, in Turnover, by Thomas
the only surviving son of his uncle, George Westby, whose death
occurred in 1776; whilst he bequeathed Mowbreck and White Hall
to George, the eldest son of this Thomas Westby, by his wife
Anne, the daughter of John Ashley, of London. The Westbys,
of White Hall and Mowbreck, sold their property at the former
place in recent years to the late John Stevenson, esq., of Preston
and Lytham. Reverting to the earlier Westbys, we find that the
active parts played by George and Bernard Westby in the Civil
Wars resulted in the confiscation of the White Hall estate by
Parliament; and in 1653 it was sold by the Commissioners of
State, being purchased for the Westbys again by, and in the
names of, some of their Protestant friends.</p>

<p>Upper Rawcliffe Hall was rebuilt about the time of its purchase
by the Westbys, who conferred upon it the new title of White
Hall. This mansion stood by the side of the river Wyre, and was
approached through a noble gateway. The windows were mullioned,
and two bays projected from the north-west front; within
were secret chambers and a private chapel. The Hall is now a
farm house. Turnover Hall, the ancient seat of the Shuttleworths,
and afterwards one of the mansions of the Westbys, as
already shown, presents nothing of special interest to our notice.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_457"></a>[457]</span>
St. Michael’s Hall, the residence of the Longworths<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> during the
seventeenth century, and probably of the Kirkbys before them,
has since been rebuilt in an antique style, and converted into a
farm house.</p>

<p>Tarnacre was claimed, amongst other places, by the abbot of
Cockersand in 1292, during the reign of Edward I., and was,
with Upper Rawcliffe, in early days, a feudal appendage of
Garstang.</p>

<p>The township of Upper Rawcliffe-with-Tarnacre contains the
ancient parish church of St. Michael’s-on-Wyre, which occupies
a prominent and picturesque station on the banks of the narrowed
Bleasdale stream, in the midst of the rural village, to which its
title has been extended. St. Michael’s church, or <i>Michelescherche</i>,
as it appears in the Survey of William the Conqueror, was
obviously standing on the arrival of that warrior in 1066, being,
with the exception of a similar structure at Kirkham, the only
edifice of its kind existing in the Fylde at that time. There are
no records amongst the meagre annals of Amounderness during
the Saxon era, to assist us in establishing beyond question the
antiquity of this church, but it may reasonably be supposed that
its erection took place at no long interval after the year 627, when
Paulinus was appointed bishop of the province of Northumbria,
in which St. Michael’s was situated. The zeal and piety displayed
by Paulinus are said to have exercised an important influence in
overcoming the pagan tendencies of the inhabitants of Lancashire,
and although it is far from probable that the whole of the people
of the Fylde at once became converts to Christianity, and
renounced their heathenish and superstitious ritual, still it would
be idle to deny that the ministrations of so earnest a prelate as
Paulinus were fruitful to a considerable degree in our district,
more especially when history proclaims the success of his efforts
in other portions of his diocese. The small band of professed
Christians would gradually extend their circle, and at no remote
date a building would become necessary where divine worship
could be conducted in a decent and orderly manner, according to
the direction of the newly-adopted creed; and it was, we opine,
at such an epoch that the church of St. Michael’s-on-Wyre was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_458"></a>[458]</span>
first called into being. After the Norman Conquest the church
formed an item of the princely estate of Roger de Poictou,
acquired through the partial munificence of William I.; and possibly
in 1094, or thereabouts, was conferred by him upon the priory
of St. Mary’s, at Lancaster, in like manner to similar ecclesiastical
possessions which he held in Kirkham and Poulton. However
that may be, it is learnt from the <i>Testa de Nevill</i> that rather more
than a century after the foundation of the monastic house in the
year just named, the advowson of St. Michael’s was vested in
King John, who presented Master Macy to the living,<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> then
valued at £66 13s. 4d. per annum. In 1326, William de
Walderston, rector of the church of St. Michael’s, and the prior
of Lancaster, were engaged in a controversy before the authorities
of Richmond, respecting the forest and other tithes of Myerscough,
and those of a place called Migchalgh, the suit being
decided at Lancaster on the 13th of October against the rector.<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>
Nineteen years later, Henry, earl of Lancaster, was patron of the
living, and in 1411 Henry IV., duke of Lancaster, who had claimed
and obtained the crown resigned by Richard II., conveyed St.
Michael’s church to the Master and Brethren of the College or
Chantry of the Blessed Mary Magdalen, at Battlefield, near
Shrewsbury, nominally established by himself.<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> The letters-patent
by which the transfer was effected, bore the Duchy seal,
and stipulated that Roger Yve, of Leeton, Keeper and Master of
the College concerned (really its founder), and his successors,
should, in return for the grant, make the following provision for
the maintenance of a vicar at the church of St. Michael’s:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Vicar and his Successors to receive, have, and possess, the offerings and
revenues which are and belong to the church of Michaelskirk, together with the
fruits and offerings arising from Hay and Revenues; the Tenth of Gardens dug
with the foot, of Lambs, Calves, Young Foals, Poultry, Young Pigs, Geese, Eggs,
Milk, Wool, Flax, Hemp, Mills, Apples, Garlick, Onions, Fishes, and Pigeons;
the first fruits of the Dead, otherwise called Mortuaries, whether they consist of
Animals, Clothes, or any other thing whatsoever, together with our Pool and
Mill, and also the Pool upon Wyre near the Rectory of Michaelskirk; and
further, the same Vicar and his Successors to have for their Dwelling the straw-thatched
Porch below the Rectory, and the Door and House adjoining, with the
Dovecote and Orchard near the Porch, and the Fishponds and Moats.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_459"></a>[459]</span></p>

<p>The vicar on his part was required to pledge himself to pay all
ordinary taxes and expenses incumbent upon the church, excepting
“the covering of the chancel of the church, the payment of
40s. to the Archdeacon of Richmond, and the Tenths payable to
the King for ever,” for which the Master of the College agreed
on behalf of himself and his successors to be answerable.<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> The
foregoing grant and regulations were confirmed in 1425 and 1485
by Henry VI. and Henry VII. respectively. After the Dissolution
the right of presentation was exercised by King Charles in 1629,
who appointed Nicholas Bray to the vicarage. Subsequently the
patronage of the living has descended through several private
individuals, and is now centred in the present vicar, the Venerable
Archdeacon Hornby.</p>

<p>The parish church of St. Michael’s contained two chantries,
one of which, dedicated to St. Katherine, occupied the chapel
still existing in the north aisle. This chantry was founded some
time about the middle of the fifteenth century by John Botiler, or
Butler, lord of the manor of Out Rawcliffe. Canon Raines says
that a portion of the body armour either of him or one of his
immediate descendants remained suspended in the chapel until
long after 1700.</p>

<p>Alice Butler, the daughter of Sir Thomas Radcliffe, and widow
of Nicholas Butler, the eldest son of the founder, bequeathed by
will, dated the 20th of November, 1504, “her sowll to God and
hys Blessyd Mother and all the holye Cumpanie of heven, and
her bodye to be beryd in Christian wyse in Saynt Katrine’s
chapel, where her husband laye;” also “to the lyght brenning
there 20d; to Thomas Walton, or some wel dysposed priest to
synge for my sowll for one yeare £1 13s. 4d., solemn mass of
requiem, and other obsequies to be done as becometh one of my
degree, but not too moche expendsive so that my executors let
not (hinder not) my dowters advancement in marryage; and
to Sʳ John Butler, Clerk, 40s. a yeare togider with meate and
drynke whiles he is on lyfe.”<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> In the reign of Henry VIII.,
William Harrison was the officiating priest of this chantry, and
at that time its tenants, possessions, and annual rentals were, one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_460"></a>[460]</span>
tenement lying in Esprick, held by Thomas Dawson at 20s. per
annum; another tenement in the same place held by William
Hall at 19s.; a windmill in Stainall at 26s. 8d., and several parcels
of ground amounting to about an acre at 2s., held by Ralph Hull;
one tenement in Stainall with appurtenances held by Ralph
Hodgeson at 12s.; an acre of ground lying in a field at Stainall
held by William Hull at 2s. 8d.; two roods of land in Stainall
held by the wife of Christopher Hull at 12d.; divers plots of
ground estimated to comprise four acres in the same township
held by William Hull, the elder, at 19s.; one tenement with
appurtenances in Great Eccleston held by the wife of William
Stiholme at 13s. 4d.; and one tenement in Little Eccleston held
by Henry Wilkinson, at 20s. Hence it seems that the gross
rentals amounted to £5 15s. 8d., out of which 5s. per annum was
paid to the wife of Robert Stannall for her jointure, leaving £5
10s. 8d. the actual yearly revenue of the chantry from its endowment.<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a>
At the accession of Edward VI., Henry Harrison was
the “Priest Incumbent at St. Katherine’s Altar, being 54 years
old, and he taught a Grammar School according to his foundation.”
When chantries were suppressed the educational
institution here alluded to was probably abandoned for want of
funds and a master; in any case it ceased to exist about that
time. On the 29th of November, 1606, James I. granted to
Henry Butler, of Rawcliffe Hall, “all that Late Chantrie of the
ffoundation of John Butler, at the Aulter of the Blessed
Katherine within the Parishe Churche of St. Michaell-upon-Wyre,
in the Countye of Lancaster, lately dissolved, and all the
lands appertaining thereto.”</p>

<p>The second chantry in St. Michael’s church was founded
sometime during the fifteenth century by one of the earlier
Kirkbys, of Upper Rawcliffe, and in the reign of Edward VI. its
annual income from endowment property was £4 13s. 10d.,
Thomas Crosse, of the age of 40 years, being the priest who
celebrated there and “assisted the Curate.” Nothing more
precise concerning the origin of this chantry can be ascertained,
and even the situation it occupied in the church is unknown. In
1553 Thomas Crosse received a pension of £4 13s. 10d. a year.<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></p>

<p>The Rev. Hugh de Horneby was the brother of Robert de
Horneby, vicar of Kirkham, and it may fairly be inferred that
they belonged to the family of Hornbys, whose descendants are
now settled at St. Michael’s, Ribby, and Winwick, but lapse of
time has obliterated the connecting links. The Rev. Nathaniel
Baxter was ejected in 1662, for refusing to take the oath
required by the Act of Uniformity. Little only can be ascertained
concerning the Crombleholmes, but it is conjectured that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_462"></a>[462]</span>
they were associated with the branch of that name seated at
Goosnargh. The Rev. Richard Crombleholme had two sons—Edward
and William, by the latter of whom he was succeeded in
the vicarage, whilst to the former seems to have descended the
patronage, acquired by purchase. The Rev. William Crombleholme
married the daughter of Alexander Butler, of Kirkland,
and possibly had no offspring beyond the Elizabeth Crombleholme,
to whose memory the mural monument shortly to
be noticed, was erected. The Rev. Anthony Swainson was
the son of the Rev. Christopher Swainson, B.A., incumbent
of Copp, and Elizabeth, his wife; he was a Fellow of
Worcester College, Oxford. The Rev. Charles Buck was
the son of the Rev. Charles Buck, M.A., vicar of Kirkham;
he was afterwards curate of Warton and Lund. The Rev. Hugh
Hornby was the sixth son of Hugh Hornby, esq., of Kirkham,
whose eldest son was Joseph Hornby, esq., D.L., of Ribby Hall.
He married Ann, daughter and co-heiress of Joseph Starky, M.D.,
of Redvales, and had issue, one son, William, now the Venerable
Archdeacon Hornby, who succeeded him in the living, and is the
present vicar and patron. The Ven. Archdeacon Hornby is an
honorary canon of Manchester, and has been twice married, but
further information respecting the family will be found in the
pedigree of “Hornby of Ribby Hall.”</p>

<p>The present church is a broad low building of rough stone, with
a tower of similar character at the west end. Both the tower and
church are surmounted and surrounded by a castellated stone
parapet and ornamental pinnacles of the same material. The porch
and the tower bear the date 1611 and initial letters H:B. upon their
exteriors, but it is evident that much of the edifice can boast a
considerably greater antiquity than that indicated by the corresponding
inscriptions. It is also obvious from the varieties
displayed in the architecture of different portions, more
especially the windows, that the rebuilding of the church has
not been accomplished all at once, but carried on at pretty long
intervals, extending back certainly to the time of Henry VIII., and
perhaps further. Within, the south side aisle is separated from
the nave by a succession of stone arches running from east to
west, whilst the north side aisle contains the chapel in which was
placed the altar of St. Katherine, and where now is the following<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_463"></a>[463]</span>
inscription:—“This Oratory, known before the Dissolution to
have been a Chantry dedicated to Saint Katherine, and
competently endowed with lands in the neighbouring townships,
was repaired by John ffrance, esq., of Rawcliffe Hall, A.D. 1797,
being an appendage to that ancient manor house.” The tower
opens directly into the nave without even the semblance of a
partition, and on one wall is fixed a brass plate intimating that
the large clock, whose huge pendulum vibrates opposite, and
whose dials are visible without, was presented, in 1850, to the
Ven. Archdeacon Hornby by his parishioners, as a mark of esteem.
The mural tables occupying stations within the aisles and nave
are erected to the memories of Edward Greenhalgh, of Myerscough
Hall, died in 1823, aged 53, and Margaret, his widow, died in 1853,
aged 92, also Mary, died in infancy, and Charlotte, died in 1823,
aged 29, their daughters; Thomas Westby, of White Hall, died
in 1762, aged 47, and Margaret, his widow, died in 1802, aged 82,
also their children—Mary, died in infancy, Joseph, in 1769, aged
16, Bridget, in 1786, aged 37, Robert, in 1800, aged 45, Mary, in
1805, aged 45, William, in 1811, aged 60, and John, in 1811, aged
65—Thomas, the only surviving child being the erector of the
monument in 1812; Hugh Hornby, M.A., 56 years vicar of the
parish, died in 1847, aged 81, and Anne, his widow, died in 1850,
aged 81 years, also Joseph Starkey Hornby, born in 1839, died in
1858, and William Hornby, born in 1845, died in 1858—“They
were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they
were not divided”; Henry Hornby, late Captain in the East
India Service, died in 1794, aged 54, “also near this place were
interred the remains of his late father, Thomas Hornby, of St.
Michael’s, who died Mar. 8, 1785, aged 76, likewise Elizabeth, wife
and mother to the above, who died May 14th, 1798, aged 84”;
Elizabeth Crombleholme, daughter of the Rev. William Crombleholme,
formerly vicar of the parish, “whose mortal remains were
deposited in the graveyard of this church near those of her beloved
parents on the 21st of May, 1817—Erected as a tribute of esteem
by her affectionate relative Thomas Butler Cole, of Kirkland Hall.”
The Baptistry was restored in 1852 by the surviving children of
John and Susannah Swainson, of Preston, and contains several
tablets affixed to the north wall in memory of numerous members
of that family, amongst whom may be mentioned the Revs.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_464"></a>[464]</span>
Christopher Swainson, B.A., incumbent of Copp, died in 1775;
Anthony Swainson, M.A., vicar of St. Michael’s-on-Wyre, died
1784, aged 42; and Christopher Swainson, M.A., prebendary of
Hereford, and vicar of Clun, Salop, died in 1854. The burial
ground surrounding the church presents nothing of much interest
to the antiquarian beyond an old sun-dial, and the Crombleholme
grave lying under the shadow of the east wall. The living is a
discharged vicarage.</p>

<p>The following extracts from the ancient vestry books will
doubtless be interesting to our readers, although not of much
importance as parish records:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“April, 1683: To Ann Raby for washing surplice, 4s.; to John Fisher for work
for clock and bells, 8s. 6d.</p>

<p>“Ordered this 21st of June, 1683, that no person or persons for the future be
admitted to bury any dead corpse in the church unless he or they, at whose
instance such corpse shall be buried, do in hand pay to the sexton of the parish
for the same, being 12 pence for the use of the parish, or sufficiently secure the
same to him, the corpses of women dying in childbed only excepted, which are
hereby intended to be free, as is usual in other parishes.—Thos. Robinson, vicar;
Rich. Longworth, Thos. White, gents.; Jas. Raby, Rich. B. Hornby, Rich.
Wilding, George Bennet, churchwardens.”</p>

<p>“May 18, 1688: It is ordered that the two former orders made, the one ffor
destroying Magpie and Sparrow heads, and the other for allowing the churchwardens

<p>In 1708 Richard Cornall gave £40 to be invested, and the
interest applied towards the maintenance of a schoolmaster for
Upper Rawcliffe-with-Tarnacre, and in 1808 Joseph Fielding, of
Catterall, was the sole remaining trustee of a sum of money,
amounting to £60, of which the £40 doubtless formed part, for
educational purposes. At that date Joseph Fielding induced the
Rev. Hugh Hornby, vicar of St. Michael’s-on-Wyre, and William
Harrison, of Upper Rawcliffe, to undertake the trust with him on
a fresh deed, the old one having been lost. A new schoolhouse
was shortly erected on the site of the former building, and is now
governed by the representatives of the trustees named. In 1813
Mrs. Elizabeth Crombleholme left £200 in trust to be invested,
and the annual income therefrom paid to the master of
St. Michael’s-on-Wyre school for teaching three poor children of
the parish to read, write, and cast accounts.</p>

<p>Bread-money was probably established during the lifetime of
John ffrance, of Rawcliffe Hall, and arises from “two-sevenths of
the clear rent of a close of ground lying in Kirkham, purchased
with £20, to be distributed to the poor attending divine service
in the parish church of St. Michael’s, at the direction of John
ffrance, esq., and his heirs; Thomas Langton, gent., and his heirs;
and the vicar of St. Michael’s for the time being.”<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>

<p>Ralph Longworth, esq., of St. Michael’s Hall, left £5 per annum
to the vicar, and £2 10s. to the poor of Upper Rawcliffe.</p>

<p>Thomas Knowles, gent., left £2 10s., and John Hudson, gent.,
£2 a-year to the poor of the same township.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_466"></a>[466]</span></p>

<p>The Terleway’s Lands were given by some one unknown at a
very early date “for the use of the parish, as the vicar and vestry
shall direct,” and consist of lands in Claughton and a garden in
Upper Rawcliffe-with-Tarnacre.<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p>

<p>The area of the township embraces 3,743 statute acres.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great Eccleston.</span> Great Eccleston was anciently held by
William de Lancaster as an appendage of the fee of Wyresdale.
William de Lancaster died without issue, and Wyresdale, with
its dependency Great Eccleston, passed to Walter de Lindsay, the
eldest son of his second sister, Alice. The Lindsay line terminated
in the heiress Christiana de Lindsay, living in 1300, who married
Ingelram de Guynes, Lord of Coucy, in France, whose eldest son
was created earl of Bedford in 1336, and whose second and third
sons, Sir William de Coucy and Robert de Coucy, held Great
Eccleston as part of Wyresdale, their inheritance, in 1346.
The widow of Sir William de Coucy conveyed her portion
of Great Eccleston in marriage to Sir John de Coupland, and the
remainder was then held by Baldwin de Guynes and Joan, the
heiress of John de Rigmayden. The whole of the township, with
the exception of certain lands rented by the convent of Deulacres,<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>
descended in the manner above described from William de
Lancaster, through the Lindsays and Guynes or Coucys, to
Coupland, Baldwin de Guynes, and Joan Rigmayden, and subsequently
to their heirs. Amongst the <i>Familiæ Lancastrienses</i>
there are two families of Ecclestons, one of which is described as
of Eccleston, near Preston, and the other of Eccleston simply, the
latter doubtless being the Ecclestons who were seated at Great
Eccleston Hall anterior to the Stanleys, the occupants in the
seventeenth century, whose pedigree will be found, with others, in
a former chapter of this volume. The Ecclestons, of Eccleston,
near Preston, would belong to the place of that name in the
Hundred of Leyland. Thomas Stanley, an illegitimate son of
the fourth earl of Derby, settled, about 1600, at Great Eccleston
Hall, which, together with the estate, was probably purchased;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_467"></a>[467]</span>
his descendants remained there until the death of Richard
Stanley, in 1714, when Thomas Westby, of Upper Rawcliffe,
obtained possession of the land and mansion, both of which have
since descended in his line.</p>

<p>An Episcopal chapel was erected, in 1723, on the summit of a
hill at Copp, almost a mile from the village of Great Eccleston,
and near to Elswick chapel, “which,” says Bishop Gastrell, “being
never consecrated and in the possession of the Dissenters, it was
thought more proper to build a new one there than to seize upon
that.” Subjoined is a letter from John ffrance, of Little
Eccleston Hall, to William Stafford, Commissary of Richmond,
and Secretary to Bishop Gastrell, called forth by sundry matters
in connection with the newly completed place of worship:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“Eccleston parva, Aug. 3, 1724.</p>

<p>“Upon some discourse with Mr. Dixon (vicar of Kirkham) about Cop Chapell
I will give you the trouble of this. When Subscriptions were desired towards
building the said Chapell it was proposed and intended to be not only for the use
of the Inhabitants of St. Michael’s, but likewise for the use of several townships,
which lye in the Parish of Kirkham, remote from their Parish Church; and the
Inhabitants of this township (Little Eccleston-with-Larbrick) have contributed
more towards the Building than those of St. Michael’s, and would have erected
it within Kirkham Parish, if the situation had been thought equally convenient.
And likewise the person, who promised to pay the hundred pounds towards the
Queen’s Bounty, gave a note touching the same, with conditions in favour of
Kirkham Parish.</p>

<p>“Before the Chapell was erected the two Vicars of the Parishes aforesaid were
together, seemed to encourage our proceedings, and talked amicably and agreeably
about Nomination, etc.; but since the Chapell was built several proposals have
been made to which the Vicar of Kirkham has consented, but the Vicar of St.
Michael’s seems to dislike them. One of the proposals was that the determination
of the affair might be referred to the Bishop of Chester, whose generous offer to
procure £100 towards the Endowment of this Chapell gave great encouragement
to our undertaking the building thereof. Some people have refused to pay their
Subscriptions on pretence that the Vicar of St. Michael’s has departed from
former proposals; but we hope (if these differences could be amicably settled to
the satisfaction of the neighbourhood) that not only the old, but likewise several
new Subscriptions might be procured, especially if our grateful behaviour for
by-past favours may continue his Lordship’s Countenance and Encouragement;
and we desire you to represent the matter to him as favourably as you think it
will bear.”</p>

<p>The chapel was a small plain brick building, dedicated to
St. Anne, but in 1841 a tower was added, and at the same time
a burial ground was enclosed and licensed in connection with it.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_468"></a>[468]</span>
Great Eccleston, Elswick, and Little Eccleston-with-Larbrick
townships were, in 1849, constituted a separate ecclesiastical
district, known as the parish of Copp, of which this chapel is
the parochial church. There is a vicarage house.</p>

<p>A new Catholic chapel was completed in 1835, and superseded
one of considerable age. Three fairs are held each year on
March 14th, April 14th, and November 4th, for cattle.</p>

<p>The origin of the free school at Copp has not been discovered,
but the earliest endowment to be found dates from 1719, when
William Fyld, yeoman, of Great Eccleston, left the remainder of
his personal estate, amounting to about £250, to be invested in
trustees, and the interest to be paid yearly “for a Master to teach
Poor Children here, or in some other part of the township.” By
his will, dated 1st of April, 1748, William Gaulter bequeathed
£242 14s. to certain trustees to augment the stipend of the
master of this school, and directed that in case the educational
establishment should ever be abandoned, or the terms of the will
not be observed, the annual income derived from his bequest
should be distributed amongst the poor inhabitants of the
neighbourhood. In 1866 the school was temporarily closed, whilst
the charity was under the revision of the Charity Commissioners;
and in 1871 a new and more commodious building was erected.
There is also another school in this township, called Lane Head
school, held in a building erected by subscription on the site of
the original one, which had collapsed through age. The only
endowment is a rent charge of £5 supposed to have been left by
Thomas Clitherall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_469"></a>[469]</span></p>

<p>William Fyld, of Great Eccleston, bequeathed £2 annually to
the poor of that township.</p>

<p>Ellen Longworth left the interest of £20 to be distributed in
bread to the poor people attending divine service at Copp church.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Out Rawcliffe.</span> The manor of Out Rawcliffe was presented
to Theobald Walter by Richard I., and from that time to 1715
remained in the hands of the same family. Theobald Walter,
the son of the above-named gentleman, and <i>Butler</i> of Ireland,
a title which, as elsewhere stated, he adopted as a surname,
gave the whole of Out Rawcliffe, and one carucate of land in
Stainall, to his relative, perhaps son, Sir Richard Butler,
and from him sprang the long line of Butlers of Rawcliffe.<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> In
1627 the inquisition <i>post mortem</i> of Henry Butler, of Rawcliffe
Hall, revealed that his possessions consisted of the two manors of
Out and Middle Rawcliffes, and of lands in Upper Rawcliffe.<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a>
Henry and Richard Butler of Rawcliffe, father and eldest son,
joined the ranks of the insurgents in 1715, and after the suppression
of the rebellion, their estates were confiscated; Henry
escaped, but Richard was seized, and died in prison at London in
1716, before the day appointed for his execution. The sale of
Out Rawcliffe by Government was enrolled on the 19th of
September, 1723, the purchasers being the Rev. Richard Crombleholme,
(vicar of St. Michael’s), John Leyland, Cornelius Fox,
and James Poole; and in the diary of the Rev. Thos. Parkinson,
curate of Garstang, reference is made to the completion and
terms of the transfer as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“April 1723.— ... At night I preached for T. Raby, of Tarnacre, at
St. Michael’s. His son paid me 10s. Mr. Crombleholm, the vicar there, came
from London, whilst I was there, who, in conjunction with three more, had
bought Rawcliffe demain and tenants, paying to the board £11,260. It cost
them near £1,000 more in hush money, as they call it.”</p>

</div>

<p>In 1729 the Rev. Richard Crombleholme, who seems to have
bought up the shares of his co-investors, died, and five years later
his heir, Edward Crombleholme, disposed of the lordship of Out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_470"></a>[470]</span>
Rawcliffe, with its courts, fishing in the Wyre, rents, etc., to
Thomas Roe, whose only child and heiress married John ffrance,
of Little Eccleston Hall. The only son and heir of John ffrance,
of Rawcliffe and Little Eccleston, also called John, became lord
of the manor on the decease of his father in 1774. He espoused
Margaret, the daughter and heiress of ⸺ Rigg, of Lancaster,
and, dying without issue, devised his property, after the death of
his widow, to Thomas Wilson, of Preston, whose wife, the
daughter of ⸺ Cross, of Shaw Hall, Chorley, was his nearest
relative. Thomas Wilson assumed the surname of ffrance in
addition to his own, and was succeeded, under the will of John
ffrance, by his son, Thomas Robert Wilson-ffrance, who effected
great improvements on the land by draining and re-covering the
mosses, thereby increasing the value of the estate considerably.
T. R. Wilson-ffrance died in 1853, and Rawcliffe descended to
his only son, Robert Wilson-ffrance, who lived but six years
afterwards, and bequeathed his estates to his sole offspring,
Robert John Barton Wilson-ffrance, esq., at that time an infant,
and now in possession. Rawcliffe Hall lies on the south of the
township, in a park-like enclosure, leading to the banks of the
river Wyre. The present mansion was built in the 17th century,
but during more recent years has undergone material alterations.
The remains of the Catholic chapel attached to it are situated at
the rear.</p>

<p>The church of Out Rawcliffe was consecrated in 1837, and was
erected by subscription and a donation from the late T. R.
Wilson-ffrance, esq., who also gave the site, and retained the
patronage. The style of architecture is said to resemble some
portions of the ruins of Glastonbury Abbey, with a fine Norman
arch over the west end. There are 250 sittings, of which 150 are
free. The first incumbent was the Rev. W. Chadwick, who was
succeeded by the Rev. Joshua Waltham. The Rev. James C.
Home, M.A., is the third and present holder of the living.</p>

<p>There is a good day-school supported out of the Rawcliffe estate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elswick.</span> From the <i>Testa de Nevill</i> it appears that about
1400 Warin de Wytingham and Alin de Singilton held respectively
the eighth and sixteenth parts of a knight’s fee in Elswick
from the Earl of Lincoln. Edmund Dudley had the manor
until his attainder at the beginning of the reign of Henry VIII.;
and in 1521, Thomas, earl of Derby, held it of that monarch.
The soil is now in the possession of several landowners.</p>

<p>In 1650 the Parliamentary Commissioners of the Commonwealth
reported that the inhabitants, “being fifty families, and
five miles from their parish church, had lately, with the voluntary
and free assistance of some neighbouring towns, erected a chapel.”
The Rev. Cuthbert Harrison, who had been ejected from his
benefice in Ireland for refusing the oath of Uniformity, procured
a license from Charles II. in 1672 for the same chapel, “for the
use of such as did not conform to the Church of England, commonly
called Congregational.” Parliament, however, decreed
that the King’s authority was insufficient, and forbade divine
service to be held there a short time later. In 1702 the chapel
seems to have been again opened, and continued in use amongst
the Independents until 1753, when it was superseded by a new
one, enlarged in 1838. The memorial stone of the present chapel,
erected to commemorate the persecutions under the Five Mile
Act of two centuries ago, was laid by Sir James Watts, of Manchester,
on the 30th of July, 1873, and the building completed
with all expedition. The chapel stands on a plot of ground presented
by Mrs. Harrison, of Bankfield, adjoining the site of the
former edifice, and is a handsome stone Gothic structure. The
mortuary, with tower and spire, was given by R. C. Richards,
esq., J.P., of Clifton Lodge, in memory of certain members of
his family.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Hoole, by will dated 26th of April, 1727, charged a
meadow in Elswick, which she gave to the Roman Catholic
chapel of Great Eccleston, with the annual payment of £3 to the
poor of Elswick.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wood Plumpton.</span> In the Domesday Book Pluntun is entered
as comprising two carucates of arable land. Robert de Stokeport
died possessed of the manor in 1248, and his daughter and heiress
married Nicholas de Eton as her first husband, and John de
Arderne as her second. Robert de Eton, a descendant of her
first marriage, obtained Wood Plumpton in 1340. Cecily de
Stokeport, heiress of the Etons, conveyed the manor to Sir
Edward Warren, of Poynton, in which family it remained until
transferred, in 1777, to Viscount Thomas James Bulkeley on his
marriage with Elizabeth Harriet, only child of Sir George
Warren. The Bulkeley property ultimately passed to the
Fleming-Leycesters, whence Lord de Tabley obtained the lordship.
Charles Birley, esq., of Bartle Hall, is the present possessor of the
manor. Wood Plumpton Hall was anciently the seat of the
Warrens, whilst Ambrose Hall was occupied by a family of the
same name, from which descended the Rev. Isaac Ambrose, who
was ejected from Garstang by the Act of Uniformity. Richard
Ambrose, of Ambrose Hall, left a son and heir, William, who
married the daughter of ⸺ Curwen of Lancaster, and had issue
a son, Nicholas. Nicholas Ambrose espoused Jane, daughter of
John Singleton, of Gingle Hall, Lancashire, and left six sons and
a daughter, the eldest of whom, William, resided at Ambrose Hall
in 1567, and was twice married, first to Anne, widow of Lawrence
Cotham, of St. Michael’s-on-Wyre, and after her decease to
Margaret, widow of Sir Richard Houghton. Flower’s heraldic
visitation, from which the foregoing is extracted, was made in
1567, and consequently the pedigree cannot be traced further.</p>

<p>The church of Wood Plumpton is very ancient, being probably
in existence during the earlier years of the 14th century. It was
rebuilt in 1630, and has subsequently undergone numerous
alterations, consisting now of nave, chancel, and two aisles. The
communion table has the date and initials “W. A. 1635” upon
it, and a beam in the roof is carved with the year “1639.” An
organ was obtained in 1849. The principal window, the gift of
R. Waterworth, esq., of Preston, is beautifully emblazoned, in
addition to which there are several other richly stained windows.
A handsome monument of marble, representing a sailor mourning,
is situated in the north aisle, and was erected in memory of
Henry Foster, R.N., F.R.S., son of a former incumbent who was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_473"></a>[473]</span>
drowned in 1831, in the river Chagres, Gulf of Mexico. The
church is dedicated to St. Anne, and the Rev. Isaac Mossop is the
present vicar.</p>

<p>There is a Roman Catholic chapel at Cottam, erected in 1793.
The date of the original one is unknown, but in 1768 it was
almost completely destroyed by an election mob. A Wesleyan
chapel was built in 1815, and another for the Primitive Methodists
about 1819.</p>

<p>The township contains an auxiliary workhouse, connected with
the Preston Union, which was erected in 1823. Annual courts
are held for the manor of Wood Plumpton, which includes the
hamlets of Catforth, Eaves, Bartle, and Wood Plumpton.</p>

<p>The school at Catforth was established by Alice Nicholson, of
Bartle, who gave in 1661 the sum of £100 in trust for the maintenance
of a free school within the manor of Wood Plumpton.
Subsequent benefactions have been received as follows:—The
same Alice Nicholson £10 by will, in 1664; John Hudson, of
Lea, £20 by will, in 1676; John Hall, of Catforth, £20 by deed,
in 1732; James Hall, of Catforth, £10 by will, in 1741; Richard
Eccles, £100 by will, in 1762; Elizabeth Bell, £100 by deed, in
1813; Richard Threlfall, £20 by deed in 1813; and Ann Robinson,
£90 by will in 1817. The total endowment up to 1813,
amounting to £380, was invested on the 21st of April in that
year, in the navy five per cents., in the name of the trustees.
The further bequest of £90 was placed out at interest.</p>

<p>In 1817, Ann Robinson, the benefactress just mentioned, also
left £90 in trust, the interest to be given to the master teaching
the Sunday school at Wood Plumpton church.</p>

<p>Thomas Houghton gave, in 1649, the fourth part of the rental
of an estate in Wood Plumpton to the poor of that township.</p>

<p>It is recited in an indenture, dated 9th January, 1709, that
George Nicholson bequeathed the rents of several closes of land,
which he stood possessed of for a certain term of years, in trust,
for the poor of Wood Plumpton, and also left for the same
charitable object, the sum of £200, to be retained by his executors,
and the interest only distributed, until the expiration of the above
term, when the sum should be paid to the churchwardens and
overseers, and used as heretofore. The indenture further recites
that on the death of George Nicholson in 1672, a Chancery suit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_474"></a>[474]</span>
arose out of the will, the result being that the poor were awarded
£210 as a settlement of their legal claims upon the property of
the deceased. The money was ordered to be invested, and the
annual income bestowed as directed by the testator.</p>

<p>The township comprises 4,722 statute acres.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Inskip-with-Sowerby.</span> In the Domesday volume this township
appears as containing three carucates of arable soil. Richard
Butler, of Rawcliffe Hall, obtained the manor of Inskip in 1281
as the dowry of his bride Alicia, daughter of William de Carleton.
Inskip was held by Cuthbert Clifton, of Clifton, in 1512, from
whom it descended to Sir W. Molyneux, of Larbrick and Sefton,
who had espoused his sole child and heiress. In 1554-68 it was
in the possession of Henry Kighley, and afterwards passed to
William Cavendish, earl of Devonshire, on his marriage with the
daughter and co-heiress of that gentleman.</p>

<p>The fishery of “Saureby Mere” belonged to William Hoghton
in 1519, at which epoch Thomas Rigmayden and the earl of Derby
had lands in Sowerby. The Stanleys have for long been lords of
Sowerby and continue to hold a court-baron there. In Inskip
also a court-baron takes place each year in June.</p>

<p>A church, dedicated to St. Peter, was erected in 1848 at the
joint expense of the earl of Derby and the Ven. Archdeacon
Hornby, vicar of St. Michael’s-on-Wyre. The living, now a
vicarage, is endowed with £100 per annum out of the corn rents.
The Rev. A. Sharples, B.A., appointed shortly after the church
was built, is the present vicar.</p>

<p>One-fourth of the rentals from certain lands in Goosnargh and
Chipping was given by Thomas Knowles in 1686 to the poor of
Inskip.</p>

<p>In 1750 John Jolly bequeathed the residue of his estate in
trust, for the use of such poor housekeepers of Inskip-with-Sowerby
as received no parochial relief.</p>

<p class="dropcap">In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries it was not
customary to recognise the pauper as a person
whose misfortunes, however brought about, called
for charitable aid, but all legislature was directed
against his class under the common title of vagabonds. A statute
of 1384 decreed that all vagrants should be arrested and either
placed in the stocks, or imprisoned until the visit of the justices,
who would do with them whatever seemed best by law; and in
1496 the punishment of incarceration was abolished, but the
stocks were retained. The sixteenth century initiated a little
more considerate state of things, and justices of the peace were
authorised in 1531 to grant begging licenses to any necessitous
persons in their districts unable to work for a livelihood. An act
of 1547 ordained that any vagabond, not incapacitated by old age
or illness, loitering and not seeking work for three days should be
brought before a magistrate, who was directed to adjudge such
vagrant to be, for two years, the slave of the person by whom he
had been apprehended, in addition to which he had to be branded
with the letter V on the breast. In case he ran away the law
ordered that a further branding of the sign S should be inflicted,
this time on his forehead or the ball of his cheek, and that slavery
should be his perpetual portion. A third escape entailed death
when re-captured. This enactment was never really enforced
as popular indignation at its extreme severity was aroused at
once, and after lingering two years it was repealed in favour<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_476"></a>[476]</span>
of the stocks-legislature. In 1551 it was decreed that a register
of destitute persons should be kept in each parish, and that alms
should be collected in Whit-week, whilst on the Sunday following,
during divine service at church, “the collectors should gently ask
and demand of every man and woman what they of their charity
would give weekly towards the relief of the poor.” The funds so
obtained were to be distributed amongst the poor “after such sort
that the more impotent might have the more help, and such as
could get part of their living the less.” Eleven years later a
statute ordained that if any person refused to contribute alms
when called upon he should be summoned before a justice, who
would determine the amount he had to pay, and commit him to
gaol in case of further refusal. The legislative body of Queen
Elizabeth passed “An Act for the punishment of vagabonds and
the relief of the poor and impotent,” by which justices of the
peace were instructed to register the names of all the impotent
poor who had been born within their several districts, or been
existing there on alms within the three preceding years; to assign
to them convenient places for dwellings or lodgings, in case the
parish had not already undertaken that duty of its own free will;
to assess the inhabitants to a weekly charge; and to appoint
overseers of the poor, having authority to exact a certain amount
of work from those candidates for relief who were not entirely
disabled from labour by age, sickness, or deformity. In 1575-6 it
was ordered that a stock of wool or hemp should be provided in
the different parishes for the purpose of “setting the poor at
work,” and that “Houses of Correction” should be established, in
which vagrants or tramps were to be detained, the able-bodied
being furnished with employment until a service was found for
them, and the infirm transferred to an alms-house as soon as
practicable. The “Houses of Correction,” the origin of our
workhouses, were directed to be built in large cities, or in the
central towns of wide districts, thus the one for the Fylde was
situated at Preston, an old college of Grey Friars lying to the
south of Marsh Lane being converted to that use. Dr. Kuerden
described this building more than two centuries ago as the “old
Friary, now only reserved for the reforming of vagabonds, sturdy
beggars, and petty larcenary thieves, and other people wanting
good behaviour; it is the country prison to entertain such persons<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_477"></a>[477]</span>
with hard work, spare diet, and whipping, and it is called the
House of Correction.” The present gaol of Preston was not
completed until 1789, and by force of habit the expressive title
of its predecessor has clung to it.</p>

<p>In 39 Elizabeth, 1597, an act came into force by which all
previous legislation on the subject under consideration was
repealed, and which decreed that overseers of the poor should be
appointed in every parish, whose duty it should be to levy a rate
upon the inhabitants for the support of the indigent, under the
direction and with the approval of the local magistrates; in
addition there were special regulations for the treatment of
rogues, vagrants, and able beggars, for whom whipping and the
stocks were ordered, after undergoing which punishments these
idlers were to be returned at once to their native parishes and
placed under the guardianship of the local authorities there.</p>

<p>Four years later certain modifications were made in the early
part of the last statute, but the main principle of individual
taxation by overseers, under the superintendence of justices of
the peace, was retained unaltered. The chief objects of the law
as it stood at the end of 1601 were—to relieve the lame, sick, aged,
impotent, and blind; to compel others of the poor to work, and
to put out their children as apprentices.</p>

<p>At that time any one leaving his employment and wandering
beyond the boundaries of his parish without any ostensible means
of gaining a livelihood was liable to be arrested and punished as a
vagabond, in addition he was compelled to return to his own
district in disgrace; so that whether a law confining labourers to
their own neighbourhoods existed then or not, it is certain that
they had little inducement to venture forth amongst strangers.</p>

<p>In 1662, during the reign of Charles II., the Law of Settlement
was passed, by which all members of such classes as were likely
to become at some period or other chargeable to the parish rates,
were compelled to settle themselves on the parochial district to
which they were connected by birth, marriage, apprenticeship, or
similar ties; and upon which parish alone they would subsequently
have any claim. In this way the unfortunate peasantry
and labouring population were more securely than ever imprisoned
within their parishes, for if they escaped the fate of the
rogue and vagabond, and obtained work in another part of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_478"></a>[478]</span>
country, they were generally hunted out and driven home for
fear they should become burdens on rates to which they had no
title. Such a condition of things went on with little change
for nearly two centuries, but the causes which finally brought
about a material alteration in the arrangement of pauper relief
will be noticed in the context. The erection of workhouses for
the different parishes of the kingdom was sanctioned in 1723 by
the legislature, and three years later, as learnt from the following
extract out of the minute book of the bailiffs of Kirkham, the
inhabitants of that town determined to establish one:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“22 May, 1726:—Mem. That the town of Kirkham was summonsed from
house to house, and the inhabitants unanimously agreed to the setting up of a
workhouse.”</p>

</div>

<p>The act which decreed the building of workhouses for the
employment of the poor, stated that if any one refused to enter
those houses, or objected to perform his share of labour, no relief
should be apportioned to him. There can be little doubt that
workhouses sprang up at Poulton and in the other parishes of the
Fylde about that date, as well as at Kirkham, but in their cases
there are no bailiffs’ registers, or similar records, to fall back upon
for proof as to the accuracy of the surmise, and consequently we
are unable to speak with absolute certainty. In the twenty-second
year of the reign of George III. (1782), it was enacted that
the guardians of the poor should employ the paupers of their
separate parishes in labour on the land at small remuneration,
and that the poor rate should be used only to increase the payment
to a sum large enough for the subsistence of each pauper
thus employed. Country justices, desirous of standing well in
the opinion of the peasantry, were not over scrupulous in the
discharge of their supervisionary functions, and granted or
sanctioned the granting of relief orders without any minute
inquiry into the merits of the cases. Immorality was encouraged
by an allowance from the poor-rate to the mother for each
illegitimate child. Practical responsibility for the proper
administration of the fund rested on no one, and about 1830
“the poor-rate had become public spoil, the ignorant believed it
an inexhaustible source of wealth, which belonged to them; the
brutal bullied the administrators to obtain their share; the
profligate exhibited their bastards, which must be fed; the idle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_479"></a>[479]</span>
folded their arms and waited till they got it; ignorant boys and
girls married upon it; country justices lavished it for popularity,
and guardians for convenience.”<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></p>

<p>In 1832 a Royal Commission was appointed to visit the different
parishes, and investigate the abuses which were being universally
carried on; and in 1834 a bill was brought in to amend the laws
relative to the Relief of the Poor in England and Wales, and
passed that year, some of the main clauses being—an acknowledgment
of the claims to the relief of the really necessitous, the
abolition of settlement by hiring and service, and of all out-door
relief to the able-bodied. The enactment provided for the union
of small and neighbouring parishes, the rating and expenditure of
the rates remaining a distinct and separate matter; each union
was to have a common workhouse for all its parishes, in which
the men, women, children, able-bodied, and infirm must be
separated, and where the able-bodied inmates should do a certain
amount of work for each meal. The distribution of relief was
left to the guardians and select vestries, and to the overseers in
their absence. The whole system of unions and parish relief was
placed under the control of a Central Board, by whom everything
was arranged and settled, and to whom any appeals were to be
directed.</p>

<p>Shortly after the passing of this act, the following twenty-three
townships of the Fylde were banded together for parochial purposes,
and denominated the Fylde Union:—Bispham-with-Norbreck,
Bryning-with-Kellamergh, Carleton, Clifton-with-Salwick,
Little Eccleston-with-Larbrick, Elswick, Freckleton, Greenhalgh-with-Thistleton,
Hardhorn-with-Newton, Kirkham, Layton-with-Warbreck,
Lytham, Marton, Medlam-with-Wesham, Newton-with-Scales,
Poulton, Ribby-with-Wrea, Singleton, Thornton,
Treales, Roseacre, Wharles, Warton, Weeton-with-Preese, and
Westby-with-Plumptons. In 1844 the guardians erected the
Union Workhouse at Kirkham, at a cost of about £5,400, and in
1864 the building was enlarged so as to be able to accommodate
250 paupers. All small, local workhouses in the districts comprised
in the union were of course closed on the opening of the
central one. The guardians of the different townships constitute<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_480"></a>[480]</span>
a board, in whose hands rests the regulation of all matters concerning
the union.</p>

<p>By a subsequent act, the original Central Board of Poor Law
Commissioners was superseded by a controlling board composed
of four members of the government, <i>ex officio</i>, and certain
other commissioners appointed by Her Majesty in council, the
inspectors, whom, it should have been mentioned, were provided
under the previous act, were now invested with more
extended powers; workhouse visitors were appointed; annual
reports were ordered to be issued; and a clause forbidding the
cohabitation of man and wife in the workhouses was dispensed
with after the parties had arrived at sixty years of age.</p>
